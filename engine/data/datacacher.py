# This game make use of store data (cache) in pickles. These data contain Surfaces.
# Surfaces can not directly be stored in pickles. The save_pickle_with_surfaces
# and load_pickle_with_surfaces methods in this file make use of a solution that
# makes store pickles through a wrapper class possible.
#
# alternative solution: https://github.com/pygame/pygame/issues/3054#issuecomment-1156481897
# (note that that user uses tostring, I think tobytes is better)
