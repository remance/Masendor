The swords they used were likely to be in the same category as the Viking sword (Carolingian sword) which was the predecessor to the Medieval knight sword. These swordsmen were one of the most versatile infantries for both defensive and offensive situation."

Aside from the obvious choice that is the spear, an axe was one of the more common weapons wielded by both light and heavy infantries alike. Even more so for the Norse descendants, the Normans, who still used a Dane axe just like the Anglo-Saxon infantries."

Norman army very likely employed lines of spearmen at the front to counter the enemy cavalries' charge. It may be possible that Harold Godwinson knew of this fact and was one of the factors that caused him to order his cavalries to dismount before the Battle of Hastings commenced and concentrate on defensive tactic instead of senseless charge.

When no weapon, not even the mighty crossbow, can surpass capable archers in battle. Norman army was fielded with many archers, probably in similar or more number than the crossbowmen. Out of all range weapon available during the Medieval period, bows were undoubtedly the most balance instrument for annihilating the enemy force."

Of course, due to the lack of technological advancement in the late Medieval period, the crossbows used during the Battle of Hastings were likely to be the equivalent of light crossbows. Nevertheless, such weapons were still capable of penetrating chainmail armour all the same."

Conrois were professional soldiers who received horsemanship and combat training since they come of age. These Conrois were equipped with chainmail armour, a leaf shape spear similar to Kontos lance used by ancient cavalries. Although considered to be heavy cavalry type of its own time, Conrois lack the shock impact of the medieval knights and their horses were not equipped with any armour."
