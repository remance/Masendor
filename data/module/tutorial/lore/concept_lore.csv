26,"In battle, the main goal is often to rout the enemies first before deciding whether to completely destroy them after or not. When units’ morale become abysmally low, they will begin to retreat from battle and refuse to obey any order. If morale reach 0, the unit will become broken completely and will not recover again. Although retreating or broken units will typically avoid fight at all cost, they will still fight to the death if they are completely surrounded. As stated in The Art of War: ","“When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard”.","Morale can be decreased by several ways: receiving damage, getting flanked, receiving status effect, ability effect and so on. It can also be increased by either temporally stay out of combat for a while or with ability or property effect. ",,,,,,,,,

34,,,,,,,,,,,"Commander is the king of an army. His existence keep the whole army in order and act as one. Commander provides authority bonus to every battalion controlled by him and can issues special tactical command that affect command battalion in battlefield. There will be always one battalion directly controlled by the commander called command battalion and if that battalion is routed or destroyed, the whole army will suffer major morale penalty. In the command battalion, the commander will have one bodyguard squad that represent him in the battlefield. If that squad is destroyed, the commander will be considered as dead. The position of the bodyguard squad in the battalion also affect the authority as the leader who lead their troops at the front will assure confidence in his leadership, while leading from the back guarantee his safety but is often viewed as cowardice. Therefore, consider the selection and position of the commander wisely or you may lose the battle before it even start.",

37,,,,,,,,,,,"Sub-general is the knight of an army. Sub-general is not required when creating battalion but they can bring many benefits to the battalion. Their main role is to support the general of battalion in his control and command and become his replacement if the general falls in battle. The replacement order is from left to right and there is no morale penalty for replacement until there is no general left leading the battalion. The authority bonus from sub-general is 50\% of the leader authority and command ability. Similar to the general, sub-generals also have their own bodyguard squads in the battalion. The position of the sub-general's squads do not affect the authority until they become general. Additionally, sub-generals can also use their unique abilities in the same way as general.",
38,,,,"Reserved General","Champion ","Supporter","Advisor","Apprentice",,,"Special advisor is considered the bishop of an army. Although having the least important role in the battalion, special advisor can bring additional benefit to the battalion that may change the course of battle. The special advisor also has his own squad in the battalion but can provides only 25\% of the leader's authority and do not provide any benefit from the command ability at all. However, their special ability can still be used in the same way as general and sub-general, this make the role suitable for leaders that have good or unconventional ability but lousy command or authority. Nevertheless, special advisor will become general only if there are no general and sub-general left, so choose wisely who to be employed in special advisor role. ",
