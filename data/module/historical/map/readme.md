This folder contains data related to the battle map, terrain and weather.

- texture folder keeps all feature texture file for each terrain feature combination in respective subfolder that will
  be drawn in slightly random position based on the beatiful map colour. The texture image must be in png file and has
  transparency channel or the map will look very ugly.

- Colourchange file contain list of new colour in (r,g,b) format for each terrain feature combination used in beautiful
  map. The game will draw texture by texture using these colours based on base and feature map images.

- Effect.png is the special effect that make map look like old map parchment, the image can be replaced with other
  effect as long as it is in png file with 1000x1000 size and has transparency channel. Image Opacity is recommended at
  around 50 - 60. This image will be applied after finish drawing beautiful map with both colour and feature texture.

- terrain_effect is the data of modification effect to sub-unit stat for each terrain feature combination. Each terrain
  may affect infantry and cavalry units differently. The order of terrain feature combination is sorted based on base
  terrain type (See Mapguide table 3 for the exact sort ordered).

The status in the terrain_effect is part of the subunit update code and are as follows;

1: Water will cause wet (31)
2: Rot will cause Decay (54)
3: Poison will cause poison element count
4: Quicksand cause drown damage but not wet or drench
5: Deep water will cause drench (93) and drowning
6: Mud will cause muddy leg (106)

Note that to add in new terrain or feature. the new terrain must be add as the last one with every feature. The new
feature must be add to all previous based terrain as the last in list of the appropiate base terrain. "None" can be used
for terrain feature combination that does not existed and will not be used.

These files must be changed accordingly: terrain_effect, colourchange.csv, new texture subfolder in the texture folder.

- For weather data and information, go inside weather folder.
