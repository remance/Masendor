"Battle of Mohács","29th August 1526, Mohács, Hungary. The battle determined the fate of Hungary and the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's domination over European nations. Led by Suleiman the Magnificent and under the request of King Francis I of France to undermine the Habsburg Holy Roman Empire's influence, the Ottoman Empire began an invasion of Eastern Europe in 1525. To secure the road to the Holy Roman Empire, Suleiman the Magnificent attacked Hungary. Hungary, with assistance from nearby allies, mustered troops to match their nemesis.","The Hungarian army, who knew of the Ottoman's arrival, decided to make camp south of Mohacs for a few weeks in advance. The two armies came into contact on the morning of August 29th. Exhausted from the heat and perilous long march through hilly terrain, Suleiman the Magnificent and his war council agreed to postpone the battle and set camp for the day. Sawing the opportunity to strike, Louis II of Hungary ordered a charge against the unprepared but a still much larger Ottoman army."
