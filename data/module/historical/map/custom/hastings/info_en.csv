"Battle of Hastings","14th October 1066, Hastings, England. The battle that decided the fate of England was fought between the French Norman led by Duke William the Bastard, and the English Saxon led by King Harold Godwinson. The battle took place only 19 days after the Battle of Stamford Bridge, where Harold defeated Norwegian King Harald Hardrada in the north of England. Harold rushed his army all the way to the south of England in two weeks to intercept William's army near Hastings, losing many troops during the march.","On the night before the battle, both armies organised a ""ceremony"" to prepare for the battle to come. The Saxon army held a feast that lasted the whole night with food and alcohol, while the Norman army organised a Christian prayer for the troop by the clergymen and slept until the morning. The two armies marched out early in the morning and started fighting at dawn around 9 AM until the beginning of dusk around 5 PM. No matter who wins this battle, England, led by the true king, would see major changes in every aspect.",1,2
