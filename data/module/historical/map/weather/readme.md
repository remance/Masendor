This folder keeps all data related to game weather.

- The number folders are sprite texture folders that spawn during the weather, all texture files in the folder will be
  spawned as sprite randomly at the rate and travel at speed as assigned in weather.csv.

- Effect folder consists of special weather effect texture sub-folder (name in weatherid) that spawn during the weather.
  If the special effect for that weather existed, there must be three images file (0,1,2) that will be used for each
  weather level.

- weather.csv contain all weather and modifcation for sub-unit stat, sprite spawn rate (0 mean no sprite), sprite travel
  angle and speed. Special effect is the texture effect id that will be draw into the battle map. Every modification
  value in this file is the value at weakest level of the weather (0 = Light, 1 = Normal, 2 = Strong). The second level
  double all value and the third level triple all value including sprite speed and spawn rate.

To create new weather and use it, a texture folder with the id must also be created even if there is no sprite, same for
effect folder. Icon must also be created for all 3 levels (for example weather id 20: 20_0, 20_1, 20_2).
