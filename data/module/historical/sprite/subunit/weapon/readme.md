This folder contains sprite part for each weapon and its varients.

The joint file is joint pos data for each weapon used for placement in animation. The joint pos should be the indication
for handle part of the weapon.

Position can be in "number,number" format (best kept as text format to prevent editor treating it as one value) or
string "center" for using center of the sprite image.
