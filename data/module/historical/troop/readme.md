Here in this folder is the data files related to sub-unit stat. The folder unit_ui contain texture images for both unit
and sub-unit. It is possible to modify the item already in the file but do not remove, move or change ID of the item as
it will cause error or incorrect application of the item.

Note that the effect to sub-unit stat can be classified into 2 types: Effect (e.g. Charge Effect) and Bonus (e.g. Morale
Bonus). Effect modifier will be applied to the stat in percentage. For example, 120 charge effect will be applied in
this way: sub-unit's charge * 120 / 100. Meanwhile, Bonus modifier will be applied by addition or substract directly.
For example -20 Morale bonus will be applied in this way: Sub-unit's morale - 20. It is acceptable to leave effect
column empty and it will be automatically considered as 100. Do not leave other columns empty, if there is no bonus
effect then put in 0.

Spell Preset

Concept:
Intensity affect Penetration power that affect range and duration
Quality affect damage
Quantity affect number of damage sprite per spell cast
Precision affect how accurate the spell will travel to location or occur from targeted area

cast time depends on total mana cost

Type

Instant = instant mana use, no cast time, high mana cost
Casting = instant mana use, cast time depends on mana cost, normal mana cost
Multi-casting = instant mana use, cast time depends on mana cost, cast same magic multiple times at once, exponential
increase mana cost per number of multi cast, use less mana than quantity of same number (e.g., fireball casting type
spell with 2 quantity use more mana but less cast time than fireball multi-casting of 2 times)
Channelling = intensity degradation resistance while cast, drain mana per second
