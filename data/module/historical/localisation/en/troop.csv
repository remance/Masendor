"NOR+1","Norman Swordsman","These Norman Swordsmen were a group of more affluent warriors, peasants or even mercenaries who were able to acquire a weapon as prestigious as a sword. The swords they used were likely to be in the same category as the Viking sword (Carolingian sword), which was the predecessor to the Medieval knight sword. These swordsmen were one of the most versatile infantries for both defensive and offensive situations.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR+2","Norman Axeman","Contrary to popular belief, swords were not a weapon of choice for infantry in the medieval army. Aside from the obvious choice that is the spear, an axe was one of the more common weapons wielded by both light and heavy infantries alike. Even more so for the Norse descendants, the Normans, who still used a Dane axe just like the Anglo-Saxon infantries.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR+3","Norman Spearman","Spearmen were the core of almost every army in the entire ancient world. Norman army very likely employed lines of spearmen at the front to counter the enemy cavalries' charge. It may be possible that Harold Godwinson knew of this fact and caused him to order his cavalries to dismount before the Battle of Hastings commenced and concentrated on defensive tactics instead of senseless charges.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR+4","Norman Archer","Archery is a practice that has existed since ancient times. When no weapon, not even the mighty crossbow, can surpass capable archers in battle. Norman army was fielded with many archers, probably in similar or more numbers than the crossbowmen. Out of all range weapons available during the Medieval period, bows were undoubtedly the most balance instrument for annihilating the enemy force.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR+5","Norman Crossbowman","As the evident records seem to suggest, the Norman forces at the Battle of Hastings brought not only archers but also crossbowmen into their ranks. Of course, due to the lack of technological advancement in the late Medieval period, the crossbows used during the Battle of Hastings were likely to be the equivalent of light crossbows. Nevertheless, such weapons were still capable of penetrating chainmail armour all the same.",,,"   ",,,,,,,
"NOR+6","Norman Conroi","Norman cavalries, Conrois, were the Norman equivalent of Medieval “knights”. Conrois were professional soldiers who received horsemanship and combat training when they came of age. These Conrois were equipped with chainmail armour, a leaf shape spear similar to the Kontos lance used by ancient cavalries. Although considered to be a heavy cavalry type of its own time, Conrois lacked the shock impact of the medieval knights, and their horses were not equipped with any armour.","Norman Conrois were the elite knights of the Norman army. They were partially organised professional soldiers who received training in the art of warfare since the coming of age. They typically operated and trained in a group of around 50 men. These knights were excellently disciplined and excel in both melee charging and skirmishing tactics due to the influence from the Frank and Breton neighbours' cavalry mastery.","{IMAGE:\troop\preset\lore_image\conroi_1.png}",,"Picture of Norman Conrois charging in Bayeux Tapestry.","Norman Conrois were armed with several melee weapons similar to medieval knights. Their main weapon was a leaf shape lance similar to Kontos lance but with a much shorter length. The Bayeux Tapestry also shows a picture of Conrois using a wooden club and sword as a secondary weapon. Due to a shorter length of the lance, Coirois were less of a shock cavalry unit and more of medium melee one. This is also likely why William ordered the frontal cavalry charge against the shield wall directly.","For the protection, they were equipped with chainmail hauberk and coif under a steel helmet similar to other European heavy cavalries at the time. In the off-hand, Conrois used a wooden kite shield, which provides great protection to the whole body on the venerable side and incoming missile attack. Their protective gears were made with no less than the state of the art technology available at the time.",,"Unlike other Norse descendants, the Norman army introduced the employment of heavy cavalry unit as a frontline shock troop due to the influence of their neighbours. Their equestrian skill was no doubt one of the best exemplars of early European knights. Interestingly, the Bayeux Tapestry frequently portrays Conrois holding their spear overhead in combat, which may indicate that their combat technique was maybe significantly different than the common couch lance stance used by other European cavalries. ","Although it is not clearly recorded which breed of warhorse the Conrois ride on, the portrayal of warhorse in Bayeux Tapestry demonstrates several intrigue aspects. The horses' bodies are very thick, muscular and much larger than what would be the leaner Arabian horse breed. Their heads are also disproportionately smaller than the body and the mane are short. It is much likely that the horses were of European breed, possibly the ancestor breed of Percheron horse, which also inhabit in the French region. ",
"NOR+7","Frankish Swordsman","These Frankish swordsmen were indeed a rare sight on the battlefield. In the Middle age, swords were considered a more noble weapon than most melee weapons at the time. With the majority of the medieval army primarily consisting of militia serfs, most soldiers used weapons that were cheaper to construct and train, such as axes and spears. With a Carolingian sword in one hand and a round shield in another, these men are ready for war.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR+8","Frankish Axeman","Undoubtedly equipped with standard chainmail armour and common weapon used around the Western European at the time, Frankish Axemen are likely to use one hand axe and round shield rather than the Dane axe and kite shield used by the Norman counterpart. Although named Frankish, these soldiers may consist of paid soldiers from all around Europe, of course including his french allies.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR+9","Frankish Spearman","Just like any other Medieval spearmen, Frankish Spearmen were the standard infantries of the French army in the Middle Age. Armed with a set of spear, shield and chainmail armour, they are one of the very best defensive troops one can have against both infantry and cavalry alike. The French knew too well the upcoming domination of heavy cavalry, for they themselves were one of the inventors of the finest Medieval cavalry force in Europe.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR+10","Frankish Archer","These Frankish Archers can easily dominate any other skirmish and medium infantries units from afar. With superior shooting range, well-balanced damage and reloading trade-off and arc shot capability, they are no doubt the most valuable damage-dealing troops on the battlefield. Therefore, protect them at all costs.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR+11","Frankish Crossbowman","Frankish crossbowmen were likely to share the same characteristic and equipment as the Norman crossbowmen, similar to how the Norman Conrois adopted cavalry tactics from the French knights. This is because the Normandy region was part of the Kingdom of France's territory at the time. The crossbows that these troops used would be the early type of light crossbow that lacked the shooting power of the war crossbow in the later century.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR+12","Frankish Knight","The Frankish Knights were the finest cavalry force in medieval Europe. Not to be confused with its later medieval counterpart, these knights were the early form of European heavy cavalry. The Frankish knights were comprised of lower nobles who were rich enough to buy equipment, such as chainmail, short lance, and of course, a warhorse. They are ready for charging into the enemy frontline, providing flank support or running down the fleeing cowards.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR+13","Breton Swordsman","The swordsmen of Brittany were always ready for the call to war. These Breton Swordsmen were superb frontline infantries for both their armies and allies. They will be able to hold the lines on their own while also inflicting serious damage on any fool who dares to challenge the might of Celtic descendants.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR+14","Breton Axeman","These axemen from Brittany were great additions to the frontline of the Breton army. Although not as ferocious as the Norman or Saxon Axemen who adopted the battle tactic from their Norse forefather, Breton Axemen are more proficient in defensive operations while still possessing a superb offensive capability. Surely any capable leader will be able to utilise their unmatched versatility to great effect.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR+15","Breton Spearman","In a time of chaos, even an inexperienced farmer must train in the art of combat. There was no such weapon as accessible as a spear in the era of melee weapons. Almost any minimally trained spearmen contingent should be capable of holding spears in line to form a formidable spear wall against incoming enemies. These Breton Spearmen were, of course, no less capable than any other spear infantries.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR+16","Breton Archer","For a person to be capable of archery for combat, one must train or be trained in the art for a significant amount of time. These Breton Archers were valuable prizes of the Brittany army. Although considered to be militia in war, they were no less experienced than professional archers. The sight of a darkening sky from the rain of arrows must be terrifying indeed.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR+17","Breton Crossbowman","Capable of rendering chainmail almost completely irrelevant, these Breton Crossbowmen were not to be trifle with. Only the most stalwart defence could stop the penetrating bolt of these crossbows, even if they were not as powerful as the later improved version. It is even better that these Crossbowmen can be easily trained in a short amount of time compared to their archer counterpart.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR+18","Breton Knight","Breton Knights were the cavalries that should be reckoned not less than the Norman Conrois or French Knights. They were proficient in the skirmishing tactic to harass the enemy with javelins and feign retreat to lure the enemy away from an advantageous position, making them capable of fulfilling both light and heavy cavalry roles. ",,,,,,,,,,
"SAX+1","Saxon Fyrd","Fryds were a group of local militias in the Anglo-Saxon military organisation. They were called in the time of emergency, usually against Viking raidings, by their lords. Poorly equipped with very light armour and a farming tool, club or spear as a weapon, Fryds typically served as a boost to troop number more than the main component of an army.",,,,,,,,,,
"SAX+2","Saxon Axeman","Axe was a cultural weapon of the Vikings and their descendants. Saxon Axemen were great shock troops capable of dealing savage blows against unprepared enemies. Their fine offensive capability makes up for their subpar defensive power.",,,,,,,,,,
"SAX+3","Saxon Spearman","Saxon Spearmen were the essential forefront against superior Norman and French cavalry force. They were capable of forming a spear and shield wall to create an impregnable wall even for a charging cavalry force. Of course, they are no match to the superb prowess of Saxon Huscarls and other specialised infantries. The lack of offensive skill also makes them great only for defensive roles.",,,,,,,,,,
"SAX+4","Saxon Archer","Just like the Norman, the Saxon army also employed archers in their ranks to provide skirmish and range support to its melee frontline. Although, they still could not overwhelmingly replace the still reliable slingers yet in the early Middle age due to the demanding skill requirement to use the weapon accurately.",,,,,,,,,,
"SAX+5","Saxon Slinger","Slings were still popular weapons used in Medieval armies despite the creeping domination of bows and crossbows. Exceedingly cheap to produce and effective against lightly armoured troops, Slingers provided basic range support for an early era army that lacked specialised archers or crossbowmen.",,,,,,,,,,
"SAX+6","Saxon Skirmisher","These Saxon Skirmishers are packed with javelins, throwing axes and any other throwable tools. Although called ""skirmishers"", they were typically employed behind the infantry lines to provide support from safety, which is completely different from the other specialised skirmishers, such as Greek Peltasts or Roman Veliteses. ",,,,,,,,,,
"SAX+7","Saxon Mounted Huscarl","A rare sight on a battlefield. Most Saxons did not fight on horseback and even nobles dismounted before the battle. A decent cavalry force but do not expect advantageous prolonged melee combat against enemy spearmen.",,,,,,,,,,
"SAX+8","Saxon Huscarl","Huscarls or Housecarls were the royal retinues of nordic origin and the main force of Anglo-Saxon English. They were equipped with the finest quality chainmail, a shield and a two-handed Dane axe. Their fierceness in close combat is said to be unmatched in Europe, and they will fight to the death if their lord fell in the battle for revenge.","Saxon Huscarls or Húskarlar were household bodyguards and retainers for Medieval Scandinavian culture. Tradionally, they were free men (unlike thralls and slaves) that served their lord in various tasks. The roles of Huscarls differ depending on the culture. For example, English or Saxon Huscarls duty ranged from civil administrative to the military, while Scadinavian Huscarls also refer to manservants of noble. ","The Huscarls nevertheless played an important role as elite heavy infantries in the Saxon armies during the time High Medieval period. Often compared to the legendary Jomsvikings in the old writing, it is believed that Huscarls were even more organised and highly paid by their contractors. They maintain yearly contracts with their employers and are free to leave at any time. The Huscarl order has its own code of law and organisation similar to those of the Medieval guilds.",,,,,,,,
"SAX+9","Veteran Huscarl","These veteran Huscarls were the fiercest warriors that survived multiple battles and wars. There is not much left required to prove their worth in combat. The only downside is that not many, even the finest soldiers, can survive such brutal combats and still remain combat effective. Especially in a time when medical progress was lacking, to say the least. ",,,,,,,,,,
"SAX+10","Huscarl Bodyguard","Exclusively the finest chosen group of Huscarls to be the royal bodyguard for the king in battle, these men were equipped with the best equipment the blacksmiths at the time could offer. With a strict training regiment to retain martial ability to destroy anyone that dares to bring harm to their lord, they were unmatched in most melee engagements.",,,,,,,,,,
"CHR+1","Christian Warrior Monk","Even the men of peace must arm themselves in the time of war. The participation of Christian Monks in war can be seen many times in the history of warfare. They were often garbed in monk robes on the outside with armour protection like chainmail on the inside. These monks rarely wield bladed weapons due to the doctrine of forbidding drawing blood. Instead, they utilised blunt weapons such as maces to eliminate any threat in their way.",,,,,,,,,,
"NK+1","New Kingdom Archer","The newly invented composite bow allowed the New Kingdom to become one of the ancient powerhouses in the Levant. Superior firepower but high maintenance cost that only the most wealthy country could acquire en-mass for military purposes. These New Kingdom archers could let loose a rain of arrows never before seen in the history of mankind.",,,,,,,,,,
"NK+2","Egyptian Slinger","The favourite weapon of the ancient military. Egyptian Slingers used the abundance of rocks as a weapon of war. Even a rock can easily incapacitate an elite soldier without armour and a steady shield. For thousands of years, slings remained a ranged weapon used by almost every civilisation across the globe.",,,,,,,,,,
"NK+3","New Kingdom Spearman","A standard well-round Egyptian infantry troop. Despite the lack of true cavalry force in the bronze age warfare (except for chariots), New Kingdom Spearmen is still an essential force for the expanding empire.",,,,,,,,,,
"NK+4","New Kingdom Swordsman","Equipped with a recently invented Khopesh sword,  New Kingdom Swordsmen were a force to be reckoned with. Part of a professional army employed under the Pharoah, they were swift and versatile troops that excelled in close combat. These infantries were the finest soldiers in the Bronze age that no other civilisations could imitate.",,,,,,,,,,
"NK+5","Egyptian War Chariot","Ancient Egyptians were certainly fond of their war chariots. Manufactured and maintained by the public servants under the employment of Pharoah himself. These chariots were an unmatched cavalry force in the whole world. Typically rode by Two Maryannus (elite chariot warriors) consisting of a rider and an archer. They were well-suited for shock and skirmish tactics due to their nimble design.",,,,,,,,,,
"NK+6","African Spearman","These African Spearmen were mercenaries well paid by the Egyptians both for foreign government and conquest. Their combat prowess was no less than that of the professional Egyptian infantries. The lacking discipline and defensive capability were somewhat offset by cheap recruitment and maintenance costs. When there is money to be made, even the ancients wage war against their own kins.",,,,,,,,,,
"NK+7","Egyptian Pitati","Ancient Egypt also employed mercenaries from nearby countries to wage their war of conquest. Pitati were one of the most famous examples. Hailed from the Kingdom of Kush or Nubia, south of Egypt, these Nubian archers were very proficient in their weaponry. Equipped with a bow and an axe to be ready for all forms of combat, they were an essential part of the Egyptian army in the foreign land.",,,,,,,,,,
"NK+8","Royal War Chariot","The very symbol of Ancient Egypt's wealth and military power lied in these war chariots. Pharoah and nobles alike rode them into battle and crush the inferior infantries with ease. In the desert plain, they were the unstoppable instrument of a massacre. Why resist the Gods when you can submit to their will and let the righteous ruler govern the world?",,,,,,,,,,
"NK+9","Mycenaean Promachoi","Mycenaean Promachois were elite infantries from Mycenaean Greece. Their services outside of their motherland as mercenaries were well-recorded throughout the bronze age history. Their ferocity in the Battle of Megiddo is so renowned that they gained the title of ""Demons of Armageddon"".",,,,,,,,,,
"NK+10","Kenyt-­Nesu","Kenyt-­Nesu, or King's Braves, were the elite of the elites for the New Kingdom infantries. They were normal infantries who were promoted for exceptional valour and skill in combat. These troops sometimes were foreign warriors who were a prisoner of war or mercenaries that were granted a minor noble title and a small fief by the Pharoah.",,,,,,,,,,
"NK+11","Nakhtu-aa","Nakhtu-aa, or strong-arm boys, were a unit of heavy shock infantries equipped with a Kopesh and an Egyptian bull hide shield. They also used javelins for close-range skirmishing before melee engagement, similar to Roman's pilum tactic. These elite troops are somewhat more semi-professional soldiers, which makes them more discipline than the standard troops.",,,,,,,,,,
"CNA+1","Canaanite Archer","Bow and arrow were still in the early development period. Unlike the Egyptian archers, Canaanite Archers still wielded a simple short bow. Their range prowess was only suitable for minor skirmishing and providing fire support for the friendly infantry troops in combat.",,,,,,,,,,
"CNA+2","Canaanite Slinger","A flying stone against an unprotected body or head? Fatality! A rain of stone from Canaanite Slingers can be deadly to a target without a shield. The only issue is that they are extremely venerable to any incoming attack, both melee and ranged alike.",,,,,,,,,,
"CNA+3","Canaanite Spearman","A somewhat primitive spear troop. Canaanite Spearmen provided a good defensive frontline against charging enemy infantries, but they would not be able to match against war chariots.",,,,,,,,,,
"CNA+4","Canaanite Swordsman","The development of the new type of bronze sword, “Khopesh”, saw its spread throughout the Middle East region. Canaanite Kingdoms, being former vassal states of the New Kingdom, also adopted Khopesh as part of the infantry weapon. Canaanite Swordsmen were great and balanced troops that provided the military edge that their kingdom needed to contest against the conquering empire.",,,,,,,,,,
"CNA+5","Canaanite War Chariot","Chariots are dominant cavalry forces in the Bronze age. They are very much an unstoppable force in the desert plain. Canaanite War Chariots are superb at charging enemies and rout them in a swift manner. ",,,,,,,,,,
"CNA+6","Canaanite Tribal Warrior","Still in transition from tribal states to civilisation in the Bronze age, many communities in Canaan were primitive compared to the rising empire of Egypt. This is not to say that Canaanite Tribal Warriors were ineffective in combat. While lacking the discipline of well-trained troops, these tribal warriors fought bravely. Nevertheless, do not expect them to survive against a charging chariot head-on.",,,,,,,,,,
"CNA+7","Canaanite Maryannu Warrior","Maryannu is a caste of chariot noble warriors in ancient middle eastern societies. They were elites in the Canaanite army equipped with fine weaponry and fought with the support of infantries. Their existence can be found throughout Ancient Egyptian conquest history as prized hostages after victory.",,,,,,,,,,
"CNA+8","Na’arun","Na'arun (Picked Men) are elites of the warrior caste Maryannu. They were under the direct command of a chief of chariotry and typically rode in a chariot to battle. Similar to other Maryannu warriors, these elites also possessed fief holdings and acted as nobles in the court.",,,,,,,,,,
"CNA+9","Maryannu King Bodyguard","A few elite Maryannu Warriors were also selected to serve as the king's bodyguards. With the finest training in the art of charioteer and superb (for its time) heavy bronze scale armour, they are one of the first heavy cavalry forces to smash the lines of infantry in the history of warfare.",,,,,,,,,,
"HRE+1","Landsknecht Pikeman","Landsknechts, or servants of the land, are germanic mercenaries that operate during the Late Medieval age. Their unique appearances comprising colourful clothes, hats, and armours, make them particularly well-known in the history of European warfare. The mercenary order was created by Emperor Maximilian I and Georg von Frundsberg as part of the Holy Roman Empire's army in the year 1486. These mercenaries were well-armed with good quality pike and well-versed in pike warfare.",,,,,,,,,,
"HRE+2","Landsknecht Doppelsöldner","A mercenary life is a dangerous one, especially for those on the frontline. This is why a Landsknecht band had a specific unit that served in that role. Doppelsöldners were volunteer Landsknechts that wielded a two-handed greatsword called Zweihänder. These soldiers received double payment as they were the first to charge into enemies and break their lines.",,,,,,,,,,

"HRE+5","Landsknecht Crossbowman",,,,,,,,,,,
"HUN+1","Hungarian Knight","Feudal Europe society can not function without knights. They were lower rank nobles that are trained to become elite warriors. They served as a spear and shield of the country, protecting the people with honour and chivalry. Medieval Hungary is also no exception. Equipped with heavy plate armour and armed with a lance along with the experience of equestrian since the Magyar tribes, these Hungarian knights were among the finest warriors in Medieval history.",,,,,,,,,,
"HUN+2","Hungarian Heavy Spearman",,,,,,,,,,,
"HUN+3","Hungarian Arquebusier",,,,,,,,,,,
"HUN+4","Hungarian Banderium","Banderium was a unit of elite knights made up of high-ranking nobles and clergies in the Kingdom of Hungary during the Medieval and Renaissance era. They typically served directly under the royal family, similar to knights in other European countries at the time. Banderium is derived from the Latin word ""Bandiera"", which means military banner.",,,,,,,,,,
"HUN+5","Hungarian Royal Guard",,,,,,,,,,,
"HUN+6","Hungarian Pikeman",,,,,,,,,,,
"HUN+7","Hungarian Hussar","Hussar was a unit of light cavalry in many East European countries. Originated from a group of Serb immigrants who fled from the terror of the Ottoman Empire to the Kingdom of Hungary in the 14th Century. They were adopted into the Hungarian army by King Matthias Corvinus as part of the Black Army. Their victories against the Ottoman's Sipahi cavalries popularised them to be adopted by other European countries. They typically served as skirmishers, raiders and scouts rather than shock forces.

"OTTO+1","Janissary Archer","Janissaries were elite infantries under the direct command of the Ottoman Sultan. They were among the first professional standing army in Europe and was founded in the late 14th Century. Predating the infamous musket variant was archer Janissaries, who were skilful with composite bows. These Janissary archers managed to dominate the battlefield until the end of the 16th Century. ",,,,,,,,,,
"OTTO+2","Janissary Arquebusier","The Ottoman Empire was among the earliest adopter of gunpowder weapons. Equipped with the newly developed arquebus, these Janissary Arquebusiers were capable of unleashing a forum of lead balls against enemies with incredible discipline.",,,,,,,,,,
"OTTO+3","Janissary Halberdier","Harberds were the favourite polearm weapon for Ottoman Janissary infantries. Unlike many other cultures, polearms are rarely employed by Turkish infantries due to their equestrian and nomadic culture in the early time. These Jannisary Halberdiers were employed to fight against heavy armoured infantries and cavalries alike, both offensively and defensively.",,,,,,,,,,
"OTTO+4","Janissary Swordsman","Janissay swordsmen were the core of the Ottoman army from its foundation until the 17th Century. Equipped with a curved sword and a leather round shield, their skill in melee combat can match even the heavier armour counterpart of European infantries. Conscripted and recruited solely from Christian slaves, these elite warriors were paid with salary and can rose to become high-ranking officers with enough merit.",,,,,,,,,,
"OTTO+5","Janissary Musketeer","The greatest among musketeers were Janissary musketeers. These elite infantries gave victories to the Ottoman Empire for four centuries across Europe and Africa. None of the European counterparts could match their discipline and training until the 18th Century. It is no exaggeration to say that they were the foundation of the Ottoman Empire itself.",,,,,,,,,,
"OTTO+6","Zirhli Nefer","Zihril Nefers, which means armoured soldiers, were elite janissary infantries in Ottoman empires. Only janissaries who volunteer for the role can join. They received double payment for their service and served as the first offensive group in charging assault during a siege or open battlefield. Despite the danger involved, these troops were extremely courageous and rarely retreated. Hence, they were also given the nickname, Serdengeçi, meaning the one who doesn’t care for their lives.",,,,,,,,,,
"OTTO+7","Sipahi Horse Archer","Light cavalry",,,,,,,,,,
"OTTO+8","Sipahi Heavy Cavalry",,,,,,,,,,,
"OTTO+9","Akindji Cavalry","Akindji or Akıncı were a unit of light cavalry force employed by the Ottoman Empire. Their missions were to scout ahead of the main army and initiate a skirmish to inflict damage on unprepared enemies. They were well-versed in the hit-and-run and guerrilla tactics with exceptional speed. Despite being militias with no salary compared to the other Ottoman units, they were ferocious and could operate independently from the main army.",,,,,,,,,,

"OTTO+15","Silahdar Infantry","Silahdar infantry corps consisted of Janissaries who volunteered for suicide missions and fought courageously. They served as Sultan's personal bodyguard troops and were extremely skilled in all forms of combat. However, they were considered traitors by their former Janissary comrades and disrespected by Silahdar Sipahi because of their previous slavery.",,,,,,,,,,
"OTTO+16","Topçu Ocağı","The Topçu Ocağı, which means artillery corps, were ottoman empire military engineers who operated the artilleries in both the field of battle and siege. The Ottoman Empire's primary artilleries incorporated cannons of various sizes, from small to supersize ones, which they used with such superb effectiveness that it can be said the Ottoman Empire was the pioneer of a new type of siege warfare.",,,,,,,,,,
"OTTO+17","Azap Conscript","Azap Conscripts, unlike in the name, could also be irregular volunteers for the reward of gold and war spoil. They were an infantry counterpart of the Akindji Cavalry in the Ottoman Empire's army. These conscripts were typically unmarried young men recruited from various provinces based on a quota of one man from every 20 households. Volunteers could also join the unit if they brought their own equipment. With a rank that is lower than Janissary, Azap Consscript served as frontline cannon fodder and skirmish troops. ",,,,,,,,,,
"OTTO+18","Azap Skirmisher","Azap Skirmishers, usually equipped with a bow and arrows, were parts of light infantries that can fight in both the skirmish and melee phases of the battle.
