"Name","Description"
"Beach","A relatively peaceful sandy beach with blue water. The red tide will wash away the beauty of this land."
"Cross Rivers","Four corners are divided by a cross of two rivers. No bridge in sight, so cross the rivers at your own risk."
"Desert Plain","An empty desert fill with nothing but grains of sand. The heat will be unbearable for most troops."
"Farmland","It might not be a stretch to call this place a fruit of humanity. Surely a source of stability in any civilisation."
"Garden","A huge circular garden made up of roads, rivers and a plethora of plants. An abundance of corpses will surely enrich the exceptional beauty of this place even further."
"Grassland","A plain of grass as far as the eyes can see. Only fools would fight a losing battle in this place."
"Great River","Great river at the centre and only one bridge to cross. Swimming across may work too."
"Jungle","Fight in the middle of a jungle. Guerilla warfare will be the most suitable style of tactic here."
"King Of The Hill","One hill in the middle. Only one force will be able to secure it and achieve domination on this battlefield."
"Light Jungle","Tropical land with covers of jungle spreading throughout the map. Two medium-sized rivers stretch throughout the map and will hinder troops' movement between jungles even more."
"Lone Road","A road leading to somewhere. Or nowhere."
"Oasis","Nature utopia in the middle of a hellish nightmare. Stay around the water area to maintain troops' temperature, but by doing so, they will suffer a movement penalty."
"Slope","A huge land slope. Secure the high ground first and prevent the enemies from catching up."
"Snow Plain","Land of empty whiteness. Prepare for the cold or perish."
"Swamp","Mixing the greens with the blues, swamp and marsh all over. What more can a man ever want from nature?"
"Twin Bridges","Two bridges across a medium size river at the centre of the battlefield. Mount a two-way offensive and flank the enemy."
"Twin Hills","Two hills on grassland. Secure high ground for much-needed tactical advantage."
"Water Plain","Blue shallow water stretch from north to south and east to west. The coolness of the water will surely cool down the heat of the battle to come."
