"t0","14th October 1066 AD, Duke William of Normandy and his force arrived at Telham Hill early in the morning, while Harold Godwinson’s force was already positioned at Senlac Ridge. It is believed that Harold intended to ambush the Normans at their camp and was surprised by William's early arrival at Telham Hill."
"t1","Several history records suggest that William started descending from Telham Hill and positioned his army at the southern side of Senlac Ridge. With Breton’s troops on the left, Norman at the centre and Frankish at the right."
"t2","Historically, the battle started around this time. The initial phase of the battle involved William's archers and crossbowmen raining down arrows and bolts while Harold’s infantries formed a tight shield wall defensively."
"t3","As the range attacks proved to be ineffective against Saxon's shield wall, Duke William ordered the charge for all three main contingents around this time, while the remaining archers shot skyward at the troops behind the shield wall, thus also avoiding friendly fire."
"t4","The shield wall was almost impregnable to both infantry and cavalry alike, as William's troops could not gain an advantage in this battle of attrition."
"t5","Although many sources claimed that the battle was fought continuously for the whole day from morning till dawn. It is more likely that William ordered the main forces to temporarily retreated multiple times during the battle to recover from inevitable exhaustion, which in turn also allows Harold’s force to recuperate. "
"t6","Many historians pointed out Harold's tactical mistakes at this point of the battle for his decision to remain completely defensive throughout, even when William's troops began to falter and the rumour of the Duke's death spread."
"t7","At around this time, the Bretons on the left wing of William's force began to retreat. It is unknown whether this was a tactical retreat or not, but the Saxon's right wing began the pursuit and ran down the hill despite the King's order. Which allows William's reserved cavalries to flank and rally the fleeing infantries."
"t8","With the loss of their right wing, the Saxon force lost all advantages they had in the battle. Not long after, The two Godwinson brothers fell in combat and Harold was reportedly shot by an arrow to the eye and cut down by a horseman. The fyrds began to rout immediately as the panic spread."
"t9","Both armies were exhausted as dawn came, but the Saxon army was the first to falter. With all three Godwinson brothers lying dead, the troops began to lose hope for survival. William's men show no mercy and kill every man standing, including those that flee from the battle."
"t10","It is recorded that the battle concluded around dusk (17:00) with the victory for William's force. The remaining Huscarls were cut down to the last men, and most of William's troops were completely exhausted. The fleeing Saxon troops were pursued and killed all over the place, from the nearby forest to the countryside."
"ld0","In the Battle of Hastings, many times Duke William was knocked down from his horses and presumed dead by his troops. And numerous times, he rallied back his men and assured them of his survival. This time, William's death becomes a reality in which the future of both England and the world is no longer perceivable."
"ld1","The death of Harold Godwinson marked the end of the battle in Saxon's loss. Most of the fyrd would flee from battle as soon as Harold was dead, while the remaining Huscarls regrouped at the location of Harold's body and prepared for the final last stand."
"wt1","With Norman’s victory, England would see changes to not only the government but its very own people. Although Saxon's resistance did threaten the stability of William's rule, such rebellions were nothing but a stepping stone to the current history. Now carnage and slaughter await the remaining Saxon resistances."
"wt2","Against all odds, Harold Godwinson’s army prevailed against the now pretender’s invasions that threatened the rule of Anglo-Saxons. Will England still shift its focus outward and become the prominent force of developed civilisation? Only time will tell."
