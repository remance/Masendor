"fulford","Battle of Fulford","20th September 1066 AD, Fulford, England. Tostig, the exiled brother of Harold Godwinson, returned with the Norwegian army under Harald Hardrada. The combined forces sailed and disembarked at York, where the two brothers, Edwin, Earl of Mercia, and Morca, Earl of Northumbria, awaited to intercept the Norwegian army. This battle served as the prelude to the Conquest of England.",
"stamford","Battle of Stamford Bridge","25th September 1066AD, Stamford Bridge, England. The battle between the two descendants of the Vikings, Saxon and Norwegian. King Harold Godwinson marched from London to Yorkshire (about 300 Kilometers) in 4 days after hearing about the defeat of the Battle of Fulford, foregoing his position to intercept William of Normandy to engage a much more dangerous foe, Harald Hardrada and Godwinson's younger brother, Tostig.","The arrival of the Saxon army caught the Norwegian by surprise. Legend had it that Harold Godwinson himself rode to the Norwegian camp and offered Tostig to return his original holdings. He then delivered a warning to the Norwegian King and his army that only death would be their reward. The English army then stormed through Stamford Bridge while the Norwegian soldiers rashly organised themselves into a shield wall formation. Two shield walls, two armies, two kings, only one will emerge victorious to face The Norman in the south."
"hastings","Battle of Hastings","14th October 1066 AD, Hastings, England. The battle that decided the fate of England was fought between the French Norman led by Duke William the Bastard, and the English Saxon led by King Harold Godwinson. The battle took place only 19 days after the Battle of Stamford Bridge, where Harold defeated Norwegian King Harald Hardrada in the north of England. Harold rushed his army all the way to the south of England in 2 weeks to intercept William's army near Hastings, losing many troops during the march.","On the night before the battle, both armies organised a ""ceremony"" to prepare for the battle to come. The Saxon army held a feast that lasted the whole night with food and alcohol, while the Norman army organised a Christian prayer for the troop by the clergymen and slept until the morning. The two armies marched out early in the morning and started fighting at dawn around 9 AM until the beginning of dusk around 5 PM. No matter who wins this battle, England, led by the true king, would see major changes in every aspect."
