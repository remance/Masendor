"t0","16th April 1457 BC, The Battle of Megiddo began early in the morning. Thutmose III ordered an attack after resting his army at Qina Brook the night before. The Pharoah himself led a contingent of royal chariots to the centre of the battlefield along Musmus Pass while ordering his generals to march the main infantry force in the centre."
"t1","The King of Kadesh responded to Egyptian Maneuver by splitting his force to intercept both of the Egyptian advances. Possibly a miscalculated move considering that most sources seem to agree that the Egyptian forces vastly outnumbered the Canaanite force."
"t2","The battle events are widely speculated due to the lack of written records. Most sources seem to agree that with the superior number, Thutmose III's force crushed through the ranks of Canaanite's chariots with ease and broke the infantries morale soon after."
"t3","The remaining Canaanite force retreated into the City of Megiddo and closed the gate while the King of Kadesh himself fled the battle entirely. Interestingly, the Egyptian force did not aggressively pursue the retreating enemies but rather plunder the battlefield and abandoned camp for loots. The battle ended with Egyptian victory but the war was not over. Thutmose III laid siege on the City of Megiddo that lasted for 7 months."
"ld0","The death of Thutmose III no doubt would destabilise the Egyptian empire with no direct heir to the throne and may even lead to its early downfall. The Canaanite coalition may even invade Thebes and install the King of Kadesh as the new Pharoah."
"ld1","With the death of King of Kadesh, the fate of the Canaanite rebellion would end in failure. Thutmose III began his conquest of Canaan and Syria and establish the mightiest empire in ancient history."
"wt1","Although Thutmose III managed to rout the Canaanite alliance from the battlefield in a decisive victory, the remaining Canaanite troops continued to resist for many more months in the following siege of Megiddo. The surrender of Canaan's force ensured the domination of the New Kingdom in the Lavent for many years to come."
"wt2","With the defeat of the New Kingdom, Canaanite city-states gained their newfound freedom from their long-time master. With the strength of the Egyptian empire proven to be only ephemeral, an opportunity awaited old and new enemies alike to secure the domination of the Nile Delta."
