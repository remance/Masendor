"t0","The inscriptions at the Temple of Amun-Re were the only remaining written record of The Battle of Megiddo. The record does not specify the detail of the battle but does describe how the Pharoah and his war council planned the Invasion of Megiddo."
"t1","Thutmose III, with objections from his generals, chose the most difficult and narrow path out of three possible routes from Aruna. Soldiers had to march in a single-file line, and chariots had to be dismantled and carried by soldiers. From this information, many historians manage to calculate the size of the marching Egyptian army."
"t2","Due to the unexpected route, his majesty Thutmose III's army managed to arrive at Megiddo at noon without facing any enemy on the way. The wretch Canaanite enemy was indeed surprise by this arrival and could not conduct any assualt while the rest of the Egyptian army arrive and camping at the bank of the Qina brook."
"t3","The record mentions that Pharoah declared to his troops to prepare for engagement with the wretched enemy the following morning. The army was well-rested, rationed and prepared."
"t4","His majesty, Thutmose III, rode in a chariot adorned with fine gold and led his army in the centre. By the day's end, he had delivered justice to his wretched enemy and routed them back to the City of Megiddo. The Canaanite coalition abandoned their camp and equipment during the retreat, which caused the Egyptian troops to prioritise looting instead of pursuing the enemies."
"t5","The battle ended with a decisive victory for Thutmose III, but the remaining Canaanite force in the city resisted the following siege for many more months until surrender. The record gives a very detail number list of the war spoils, such as chariots and armour belonging to the King of Kadesh and Prince of Megiddo, prisoners of war, horses, goats, sheeps, and many more objects."
"ld0","The impossible has happened, Thutmose III is laid dead on the battlefield, and the Canaanite forces seem to emerge victorious against the god chosen. Can the god Amun or Horus still alter the fate of this battle and deliver victory to their devotees?"
"ld1","The King of Kadesh is dead, and his rebellion ends with it. The almighty Pharoah Thutmose III and his brilliant strategy will always be a legacy to remember until the end of time."
"wt1","This victory demonstrates the brilliant genius of Thutmose III, who led Egypt to the highest height. All will kneel before the Pharoah in time and live only in the shade of history."
"wt2","Egypt will continue to resist and rise again. The Canaanite city-states only managed to prolong their futile resistance against their rightful ruler."
