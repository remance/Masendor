The most prominent ones are Historical Battle and Custom Battle, which players can select to play the battle they want.","In this game, there are multiple historical battles players can choose to ""enact"". The battles are collected throughout the history of mankind, from the first recorded battle until the end of the line infantry warfare era. Potentially, the game should also be able to portray modern age warfare as well, but we will see about that.",,,,,,,,,,

19,"Units","Unit represent a soldier or leader.",,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"Subunit",,"Historically, a subunit can be in various numbers depending on the army organisation that the country utilised. For example, a Roman Cohort, which is a unit of the Roman empire's legion typically composed of 6 Centurias sub-unit (roughly around 100 infantries each). Meanwhile, a Napoleonic's battalion composed of 6 infantry companies or platoons that typically made up of around 70 - 140 line infantries.",,,,,,,,,,,
21,"Troop Statistic","subunit has troop statistic that represent its capability in battle. Each statistic is used differently but sometimes also interact interchangeably with each other. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"Troop Number","Troop number represents how many soldiers exist in the unit and subunit at the time. The number is presented as ""Current Number (Maximum Number)"". Troop number can also represent the health state of the unit. The more troop number gets reduced, the less damage the unit can deal in combat. If the troop number reaches 0, the squad or battalion will be considered as destroyed.",,,,,,,,,,,,
23,"Stamina","Stamina represents the troops' current capacity to perform physical activities. Each activity requires a specific amount of stamina to performed and drain stamina at different rate whether it be simply walking or using a special ability. Units' stamina can be replenished by simply staying still or with some abilities. Noted that if troops’ stamina reaches 0, it will enter collapse state and become unable to perform any task for a while until their stamina reach a certain recovering point.","Troops' stamina is the most crucial factor that decides the tide of battle. One cannot fight enemies without the energy to swing his sword or draw his bow. Even the most well-trained warriors get tired after fighting for hours continuously. This is why many battles in history were fought for days in a stalemate. ",,,,,,,,,,,
24,"Grade","Grade represents the training level of the troops. While some grades typically are the consecutive improvement of one another, there are some that are a special class of its own, which are Noble, Mercenary, and Religious Warrior.","Each subunit grade also interact with the battalion main leader's social class differently. For more detail on this aspect, see Subsection Leader Social Class","Militia","Professional","Veteran","Elite","Champion","Hero","Religious Militia","Religious Warrior","Religious Elite Warrior","Mercenary","Noble"
25,"Discipline","Discipline represents the state of order among the troops. In order for a large group of people to perform a task in unison, discipline is one of the most crucial factors. Discipline is an important part of many troops's action and a specific minimum discipline level is often required to perform special abilities. Discipline also affect other stats such as morale and combat stats.",,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"Morale","Morale represents the unit's current state of eagerness to fight in battle. The more morale the unit have, the better they can perform in battle. ","In battle, the main goal is often to rout the enemies first before deciding whether to completely destroy them after or not. When units’ morale become abysmally low, they will begin to retreat from battle and refuse to obey any order. If morale reach 0, the unit will become broken completely and will not recover again. Although retreating or broken units will typically avoid fight at all cost, they will still fight to the death if they are completely surrounded. As stated in The Art of War: ","“When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.”","Morale can be decreased by several ways: receiving damage, getting flanked, receiving status effect, ability effect and so on. It can also be increased by either temporally stay out of combat for a while or with ability or property effect. ","The survival instinct of humans dictates that we often flee from certain death than fight to the death when possible. Almost every historical battle end when soldiers of one side decide to retreat from the battle en masse. As such, the best tactic of any battle is to make the enemy give up fighting rather than wasting your own soldier in prolonged combat. ",,,,,,,,
27,"Combat Statistic","Each subunit possess a different combat capability that is presented in the form of combat statistics such as melee attack or speed. These statistics represent how well the subunit can perform specific tasks. For example, a subunit with a high melee attack but low melee defence is well suited for a flanking attack rather than a frontal assault. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
28,"Skill","Each subunit usually possess a specific set of skill it can perform. Each skill has a specific condition, cooldown, duration and effect. While the player cannot activate the units' skill directly, it is possible to set a specific behaviour for each battalion between reserving the uses of skills or using them as often as possible. For example, one of the most common skill is'Charge' where a squad uses during running to attack its enemy. Charge skill allows the units to temporally boost their melee combat efficiency and also use special stat “Charge Power”, which increase the damage for a short duration. Charge skill cannot be activated if the units are already in melee combat.","Skills often require a specific amount of stamina and discipline to be activated. subunits will not use skill if either of their discipline or stamina does not meet the requirement. ",,,,,,,,,,,
29,"Trait","Trait or property represent a unique characteristic that the troops possess. The characteristic can influence the troop statistic and bahaviour either negatively or positively. Some equipments, mounts and other aspects such as troop grade also have their own trait that will be add to the troop's trait as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
30,"Status Effect","The status effect represents a special effect that currently affects the subunit at the time. The effect can range from beneficial to detrimental depending on the situation. The status effect can be originated from many sources such as subunit skill, weather effect, terrain effect or leader tactic.",,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"Equipment","subunit's equipment is divided into 3 categories: Weapon, Armour and Mount. Equipment has a direct effect on the subunit's combat capability. A well-equipped subunit is always better than the ill-equipped one regardless of their own statistic. The equipment also has a weight that slows down the subunit movement speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,
32,"Leader","A leader is a person who leads a unit into battle. At least one leader is always required for a unit to be combat effective. The overall combat effectiveness of a unit is directly affected by its leader skill, which exists in two categories: Authority and command. A leader is embedded in one of the subunit in the unit they lead and will also enter the combat if that subunit is in combat. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
33,"Role",,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"Commander","Commander is the king of an army. His existence keep the whole army in order and act as one. Commander provides authority bonus to every battalion controlled by him and can issues special tactical command that affect command battalion in battlefield. There will be always one battalion directly controlled by the commander called command battalion and if that battalion is routed or destroyed, the whole army will suffer major morale penalty. In the command battalion, the commander will have one bodyguard squad that represent him in the battlefield. If that squad is destroyed, the commander will be considered as dead. The position of the bodyguard squad in the battalion also affect the authority as the leader who lead their troops at the front will assure confidence in his leadership, while leading from the back guarantee his safety but is often viewed as cowardice. Therefore, consider the selection and position of the commander wisely or you may lose the battle before it even start.",,,,,,,,,,,"Commander is the king of an army.

36,"General",,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,"Sub-General","Sub-general is the knight of an army. Sub-general is not required when creating battalion but they can bring many benefits to the battalion. Their main role is to support the general of battalion in his control and command and become his replacement if the general falls in battle. The replacement order is from left to right and there is no morale penalty for replacement until there is no general left leading the battalion. The authority bonus from sub-general is 50\% of the leader authority and command ability. Similar to the general, sub-generals also have their own bodyguard squads in the battalion. The position of the sub-general's squads do not affect the authority until they become general. Additionally, sub-generals can also use their unique abilities in the same way as general.",,,,,,,,,,,"Sub-general is the knight of an army.

38,"Special","Special advisor is considered the bishop of an army. Although having the least important role in the battalion, special advisor can bring additional benefit to the battalion that may change the course of battle. The special advisor also has his own squad in the battalion but can provides only 25\% of the leader's authority and do not provide any benefit from the command ability at all. However, their special ability can still be used in the same way as general and sub-general, this make the role suitable for leaders that have good or unconventional ability but lousy command or authority. Nevertheless, special advisor will become general only if there are no general and sub-general left, so choose wisely who to be employed in special advisor role.

43,"Terrain","The terrain represents the type of ground or climate that the subunit locate at. Each terrain type has a different effect not only on the statistic of the subunit but also inflict status effect. For example, water-based terrain can cause subunits to become wet or even drown.",,,,,,,,,,,,
44,"Terrain Feature","The terrain feature represents the second characteristic of the base terrain. Each feature type combines with the base terrain indicate the type of battlefield that plays an important role for both attackers and defenders. For example, temperate terrain and plant field create bushland that is good for hiding and defence against range attacks while the desert equivalent is somewhat less effective due to the barren nature of the desert.",,,,,,,,,,,,
45,"Weather","The weather represents the current weather on the battlefield which affect all subunits equally. Weather can dynamically change during the battle and affect subunits in a different way.","Weather also has a level of strength that further indicates its exact characteristic. For example, light rain may not has many effects on subunits besides causing a wet status effect compared to heavy rain, which greatly reduces range combat capability and quickly causes a drench status effect.",,,,,,,,,,,
