"Heavy Infantry","Heavy Infantry","Great Melee, Great Defense","Slow Movement","The key player of most armies in the old history. They held the line for cavalries to flank the enemies, take rain of arrows and bullets head-on, and charge the enemies first if need be. Equipped with heavy armour, weapon and shield, few can match them in a direct engagement. Their purpose became diminished with the advent of modern firearms that can penetrate most armours."
"Medium Infantry","Medium Infantry","Good Melee, Versatile,","No Specialisation","Medium infantry became more prevalent as civilisations progressed. They are equipped with weaponry and armour suitable for prolonged melee combat. With both Defense and speed, they are the most versatile type of infantry that any capable commander can utilise in every type of situation."
"Light Infantry","Light Infantry","Decent Melee, Versatile, Fast","Bad Defense","Light infantry was the backbone of ancient warfare. Most of the time, light infantry troops made up the majority of the soldiers in an army, as armours were too expensive to equip troops in large numbers. Never underestimate even the lowest light infantries, and you will live long enough to be the master of the battlefield."
"Range Infantry","Range Infantry","Great Skirmisher","Very Bad Melee and Defense","Range infantry might not yet be the dominant force in the past compared to the present time, but it can still tip the scale of victory during the skirmish phase of the battle or in siege warfare. Typically weak in melee combat, it is not advisable to put them in the frontline unless the enemy is incapable of pulling a significant melee charge."
"Range Cavalry","Range Cavalry","Fast, Good Skirmisher","Bad Melee","The greatest tool of the conquerors of the known world. Fast and vicious, range cavalry was an unmatched force in the flat plain. As long as they do not fight in unsuitable terrain or situation or engage in unfavourable melee combat, it is almost impossible to destroy them."
"Light Cavalry","Light Cavalry","Very Fast, Versatile","Low Defense","Light cavalry had many roles, either scouting, skirmishing, harassing or pursuing fleeing enemies. They are less suited for direct melee combat, however, so use their superb mobility to avoid losing them in a pointless fight."
"Medium Cavalry","Medium Cavalry","Good Melee, Fast, Good Charge","Mediocre Defense","Medium Cavalry was not to be either under or overestimated. They were decent in melee combat and swift enough to quickly flank the slower enemy force. They, however, would not be suitable to pursue faster cavalry force or charge against heavier cavalry head-on. Nor would they be able to pierce through heavily defensive positions with ease."
"Heavy Cavalry","Heavy Cavalry","Great Melee, Great Charge, High Defense","Slow for Cavalry","Heavy or shock cavalry was the dominating force in the old battlefield. Their charge can pierce through even shield walls. The only few downsides are that they are slower than lighter cavalry and much more difficult to employ in the field in large numbers."
"Chariot","Chariot","Fast, Great Charge","High Terrain Penalty","The chariot used to be the master of the battlefield before the invention of cavalry. Although less used now, their presence can still instil fear into the enemy while crushing through enemy squads. Chariot unit usually also carry range weapon with a good amount of ammunition, which make them a decent skirmish unit as well."
"Artillery","Artillery","Long Range, High Damage","Very Slow, No Melee","Artillery in old warfare existed in many forms depending on its use. Some artilleries are more effective against infantry units such as scorpion or hwacha, while some others are more suitable for damaging structures or siege warfare like a trebuchet."
