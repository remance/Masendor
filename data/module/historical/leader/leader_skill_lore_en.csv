"L4","Entrap",
"L5","Lure","Just a piece of bait. Even the mightiest can fall to the weakest in the right circumstance."
"L6","Prayer",
"L7","Misinformation","The right plan and action can only be implemented with the right information. One wrong placement of a piece can render the whole operation crumble."
