"The political arena is not dissimilar to chess boards. The pieces of one side are the entirety of the whole country. But what is the hand that moves the pieces? The answer is simple; the hand is the collective will of the state. Without the pieces, the hand can not move the country forward, and the movement can not be formed without the hand to guide it. But one question remains, can there be other winning goals besides crushing the enemy factions entirely?"

"The face of the matter is that we are bound to the tyranny of life. We all are forced to come into the world kicking and screaming then we will be forced to die whether we want to or not. Throughout our life, we must obey the rule of nature just to live. We must eat and sleep because the law of energy dictate it. Some may say we have the free will to choose when or how we die, but that is simply an illusion of free will. In the end, we simply choose to obey the inevitable sooner. Mapolous, Infinity of Temporality."

"So let's assume that life truly has some forms of meaning and we exist to serve some purposes designated by our creator or god. This also entails that death, the end of life, must also have meaning.

In conclusion, if the scroll is to be believed, there can be no such thing as hell. Jeiloule Horgoiastes on killing and afterlife."
"I fear that if the Theory of Void Heaven is proven correct, then we face a conundrum of our very own existence.

Then we, the so-called intelligence being, are even worse than the other animals we consider to be below us for realising but never trying to truly do better. Jeiloule Horgoiastes on the void of purpose."
"When talking about life, another subject that comes up quite often is love. A positive emotion that makes us attach to something we prefer or like whether in tangible form or even just the concept of doing something. What I found more interesting is that love can be achieved and loss in a matter of second. If something that lasts for a lifetime can be altered by something so minor in one life period, then would it be truly possible to transform ourselves to a higher being that can exist in permanence state? Jeiloule Horgoiastes on the transmutation of life."
"Having been living for so long I always thought about life and what I can do with the life I have. But lately, I have also begun to think of what should I do after I die. Should I simply follow whatever the creator tells me to do if he exists? Or should I follow the flow of nature or simply cease to exist because I must adhere to the nothingness of afterlife?. I now find it weird that instead of thinking of what they want to do when they die, most people only think of what will happen after they die when they have been thinking of what they want to do for their whole life. Jeiloule Horgoiastes on the action of nothingness."
"Many frequently question me why I never really mention the racial subject in my research, consider that we are elves, the longest living being in the civilised world. I realise that all living is the same. Sure there may be the difference in stature or intelligence but in the end, all of us perish at some point. What minor difference does it make when whatever you are or accomplish will never be at the end of time. I believe the grandest state of any being is only when they attain absolute immortality. That is the ""moment"" no longer matter and they exist from before the alpha and beyond the omega. Jeiloule Horgoiastes on the permanence of absolution."
"After all this time, I have seen many inventions and discoveries made by great people. However, all of these novel creations are within the already established creation in nature. This makes me wonders if it will ever be possible for the dwellers of this world to truly create a true genesis without any point of reference, which would be equal to reaching the foundation of our creator. Jeiloule Horgoiastes on the making of matter."
