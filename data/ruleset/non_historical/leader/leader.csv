His arts were even praised by the dwarf craftsmen, something that no human ever have the grace to ever receive it. "
4,"Jonas Elbadai",100,86,4,8,3,4,8,14,3,,1,"The world is not only made of black and white. It existed in many shades of colour, maybe even the colours we can never see. So does a person and his or her characteristics. But must so-called characteristic be constant? What would happen if a person can change his personality in the matter of friction of a second? Not simply faking it but completely alters it at the very core to become a completely new identity. Can such a thing even be called person anymore or it becomes something incomprehensible entirely? "
