2,"William of Normandy","William the Bastard, William the Duke of Normandy, William the Conqueror, was the first Norman to rule over England after wrestling the control from the Anglo-Saxon king, Harold Godwinson, in the invasion of England in 1066. From the still young House of Normandy, which ruled over the Normandy region since 911, William was one of the prime contenders whom King Edward the Confessor appoint as his heir. The throne of England is always in his destiny and nothing will stop his rightful conquest.  ","William of house Normandy, an illegitimate son of Robert I the Magnificent (hence the nickname “the Bastard”), was born around 1027 AD. He became the Duke of Normandy at the age of 8 but his rise was nothing short of challenging due to his birth status. Many nobles attempted to gain custody of the young duke or organise rebellions to seize the dukedom. With the support of King Henry I of France and many prominent nobles, William managed to consolidate the region of Normandy under his rule in the end.","William first experience in warfare began in the Battle of Varaville, 1047 AD, against a rebellion led by Guy of Burgundy and the fellow conspirators. With the support of King Henry I who personally raised an army of 10,000 strongs to support William's much smaller army, they managed to win against the less organised rebel army, while being outnumbered by at least 2 to 1. The battle ended prematurely after the rebel army became disheartened after losing multiple cavalry skirmishes and broken apart.","After crushing the rebels in the Battle of Varaville, William continuously removed those who threaten his rule in a series of battles and sieges. After his rule of Normandy was firmly in place, William never stop expanding his influence, which ultimately caused great concern to both the French King, Henry I, and his court. Thus, Henry I and multiple French and Norman nobles marched to seize control of Normandy. Two invasions were attempted which result in the Battle of Mortemer in 1054 AD and Battle of Varaville in 1057 AD.","With Normandy now under his control, William expanded his control even further with the Invasion of Brittany in 1064 AD, only two years before the England invasion. Although the exact purpose of this invasion is not recorded, William managed to secure the border and also gained many Breton allies who will assist in the upcoming invasion. Additionally, it is with this invasion that multiple Norman sided sources claim Harold Godwinson assisted William in the invasion and promised to help him secure the throne of England.","Edward the Confessor recently passed away in 1066 AD and Harold proclaimed himself as King of England. William, who also claim to receive such blessing from King Edward, prepared an invasion to claim his rightful throne. Two war councils were called to plan the invasion and multiple prominent rulers at the time seem to support the invasion including the pope himself. William's army was assembled and the fleet was constructed in Normandy. ","Interestingly, the initial beginning of the invasion did not go well, the strong wind caused a major delay to the invasion, loss of fleet portion and decrease in the morale. This misfortune, however, creates a significant adventurous turn of event for William as King Harald of Norway arrived a few days earlier at Northumbrian coast. This cause Harold to march his army up north to deal with the Norwegian invasion and allows William's force to land safely at Pevensey Bay with plenty of time to recuperate.","IMAGE:ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\william_1.png","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Picture: William holding a feast after fleet landing.","In the Battle of Hastings, William positioned his Conroi knights contingent behind the frontline during the initial phase of the battle. It is very likely that in the melee phase in mid-day that he personally led the charge into the enemy infantry line. If the chronicle to be believed, William was unhorsed and almost got killed multiple times in battle, which can be the cause of rumour of his death among the troop. At the end of the day, William managed to win against all odds and came out victorious. ","IMAGE:ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\william_2.png","Picture: William in battle openning his                                        helmet to prove that he was still alive                                       and rally his men.","After the battle, William marched his army to London while also spreading his force to crush the remaining Saxon resistance around the country. Upon reaching London, William ordered the construction of the Tower of London to fortified the capital. He was coronated as the king of England at Westminster Abbey on Christmas day, 1066 AD.  The English throne would then no longer be a dream but a reality. Thus marked the end of Saxon influence in England and the Norman conquest.","With William as now king, he replaced the old Saxon law and culture with the Norman one. Many former Saxon nobles were replaced with those who accompanied William in the invasion. Unsurprisingly, many remaining Saxon nobles would continue the resistance for the years to come. Even worse, King Sweyn II of Denmark supported the rebellion and mobilised his army for invasion. The resistance would continue for no less than two more decades after the end of conquest.","William's ruling over England is not much different from his prior approach in Normandy. The constant internal conflicts, rebellion and left the country in a constant state of warfare. Not only that, many of his campaigns were considered to be genocidal in nature by many scholars today, though not really uncommon in the Medieval era. Nevertheless, his military achievement is no doubt one of the deservingly critical acclaimed by historians today.","His story did not conclude elegantly even in his death. His lifeless body went rotten before the burial ceremony, and it swelled up to the point that it exploded when stuffed inside the coffin. His throne also did not pass on peacefully for succession rebellion between his two sons occurred only one year after, and the rule of his son (Rufus, the one who won) too ended tragically with an arrow to the chest.",
3,"Alan the Red","Alan Rufus or ""the Red (beard)"" was a Breton nobleman and close companion of William the Conqueror. As part of the Invasion of England, he is the commander of the Breton force in William's army. After the successful invasion, Alan was granted amass fortune and the title Earl of Richemont and remain an important figure in William's court and ruling achievement, which later on allows him to become one of the wealthiest individuals in Europe.","Alan Rufus (the Red), son of Eudon (Odo) of Brittany and Orguen, was born around 1040 AD in Brittany. He was from House of Rennes and a relative of William the Bastard. Evident records seem to suggest that Alan was William's companion and held a sizable amount of lands and estates long before the Invasion of England. However not much else is known about Rufus in his early life before the Battle of Hastings but much of his legacies still live on to this day.","IMAGE:ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\alan_1.png","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Picture: William the Conqueror granting the charter with a green pendant seal representing lordship of Richmondshire to Alan Rufus.","Alan's accomplishment in the Battle of Hastings was noteworthy indeed. He was a commander for one of the Breton contingents, probably the infantry lines, and he was commended for merit in battle by various chronicles. For his contribution to the battle, Alan was greatly rewarded with a vast amount of wealth and lands in central England similar to other William's prominent companions. Alan remained a loyal subject of the Norman English throne until the end. ","After the invasion, Alan participated in the quelling of the Saxon rebellion in 1069 AD. Although unclear what kind of role he had in the conflict, Alan was rewarded Honour of Richmond, the region of Yorkshire. There Alan built Richmond Castle in 1071 AD that still stands to this day, albeit as a ruin that reflects only the glory of its former self. As time went by, Alan's wealth and power grew larger. By 1086 AD, Alan Rufus was one of the wealthiest and powerful individuals in England. ","IMAGE:ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\alan_2.png","             ","Picture: Watercolour of Richmond Castle in the late 18th century, by Paul Sandby and William Taverner.","In the later part of his life, Alan participated in various internal conflict and rebellion on the side of the royal throne. Even in the rebellion in 1088 AD, Alan supported William II to protect the throne against Robert Curthose, William's eldest son. Victorious in various battles and contributed greatly to the war effort, Alan remained powerful in the English court, possibly only second to the king himself, unlike many other former companions of William.","Alan Rufus died suddenly and somewhat mysteriously either in 1090 or 1093 AD of unknown cause. His body was buried in an abbey at Bury St Edmunds, an eventful region on its own. Without children, Alan's brother, Alan Niger (the Black), inherited the title and treasure of the wealthiest individual in English history and remained as the second lord until his too inevitable death.",,,,,,
4,"William FitzOsbern","William fitzOsbern was a cousin and close companion of William the Conqueror. He was a nobleman who rules over Breteuil, Normandy before becoming Earl of Hereford and Essex after Norman conquest. After the invasion, he remained one of the most important political figures in Norman England, while his name became and is still renown for many castles that he commissioned. He met his end in the Battle of Cassel while persuing the wealth of Flanders principality.","William FitzOsbern was born in 1020 AD, son of Osbern the seneschal of Normandy and Emma of Ivry. His family served the Duke of Normandy for generations and was a closed relative to the House of Normandy. With his father murdered in 1040, William FitzOsbern became the next seneschal for William the Bastard and one of the closest advisors to the duke. It is believed that being the most zealous supporter for the Invasion of England, he was the one that persuaded the opposition nobles to join the invasion.","With the successful conquest and as one of the leading figures in the invasion, William FitzOsbern was generously rewarded and granted the lordship over Isle of Wight and Hereford to already many of land-ownership under his rule. The promise of peace is still not in sight for England as the region near Wales (commonly called The Welsh Marches) was still under threat from the hostile Welsh Kingdom, William FitzOsbern was assigned as the chief strategist to create a new type of stone castle to defend the border.","IMAGE:ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\ozborn_1.png","                                                                                                                                                                                               Many stone castles did he build and still standing until this day, William became one of the major Norman castle builders. One of them being Chepstow Castle in the southeast of Wales, which is now the oldest stone castle that is still standing today in Britain as seen in the picture above.","William became one of the most prominent political figures in the Norman court. He was assigned the commander of the royal army and in charge of many regions, both as the regents and governor. The tales of this famed castle builder does not have a pleasant ending however as William saw an opportunity over the now contesting Flenders region. He decided to marry the widowed countess Richilde and rushed to her aid in the succession dispute conflict.","William joined the Battle of Cassel with a group of Norman Conrois against Robert I of Flenders in February 1071 AD. Both Arnulf III, the leader of the army, and William were killed in the surprise attack organised by Robert. His estates and wealth were then divided among his two sons, William and Roger FitzOsbern.",,,,,,,,,,
5,"Eustace II","Eustace II was a Count of Boulogne who fought in the Battle of Hastings. He was one of the commanders that lead the charge of Norman Knights and was struck by a battle-axe from Saxon Huscarl in the battle. After the invasion, Eustace rebelled against William the Conqueror due to the dissatisfaction of war spoil and possibly for a claim on the English throne. The rebellion ultimately failed but William and Eustace reconciled with Eustace retained some of his holdings and remained in William's court.","Eustace II (Nickname Eustace with moustaches) was born between the year 1015 and 1018 AD, son of Eustace I of Boulogne and Matilda of Louvaine. He participated in the failed rebellion in 1033 AD against Henry III, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and was excommunicated by Pope Leo IX in 1049 AD for marrying his second wife, Ida of Lorraine, a close relative to Eustace after his first wife died a decade ago. Eustace also became the Count of Boulogne as his father died in the same year.","In 1051 AD, Eustace visited Edward the confessor who was his relative and ally. A simple visit created a turn of event when Eustace and his retinue somehow got into a brawl with the people of Dovers. A minor event that led to the rebellion and exile of House Godwinson later on. Eustace joined Duke William of Normandy in the Invasion of England and seem to be one of the important commanders in the army. His role in the battle was noteworthy in many chronicles.","IMAGE:ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\eustace_1.png","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Picture: Eustace in the battle pointing at Duke William and yelling to the troop that William is still here and alive.","As the battle turning worse for Norman side, the Norman record writes that as Eustace was about to retreat with his knights, Duke William's reinforcement arrived at the central engagement. Eustace advised the Duke that the army should withdraw but was ignored. As the fight continued, Eustace was struck in the face by a Saxon soldier that caused blood to gushed from his mouth and nose. Nevertheless, Eustace survived the battle.","Although Eustace joined William in the invasion, many pieces of evidence seem to suggest that this is not out of loyalty and friendship. It is also possible that Eustace looked down on William for being a bastard with commoner blood, while he was part of the illustrated House of Flenders. This matter reinforces the fact that Eustace's role in battle varied widely in different chronicles, some depict him as a coward while some others depict him as a competent warrior and commander.","After the invasion, Eustace was granted reward and land for his contribution to the invasion and returned to his holding in Boulogne. In 1067 AD, Eustace launched an attack on Odo of Bayeux's castle in Dover, which ultimately failed. The reason for the attack is not clear, some suggested that it is rebellion for him being unsatisfied with the amount of reward from the invasion, while others suggest he was ""requested"" by his Englishmen allies who also joined the siege.","Eustace managed to flee from the failed rebellion back to Boulogne. He was stripped of his title and lordship in England when William heard of the rebellion. William later forgave Eustace and returned some of the confiscated lands soon later. Many scholars also suggest that it was Eustace who commisioned the Bayeux Tepastry and presented it to Odo of Bayeux to make amend for trying to attack Dover castle. This would explained why Eustace was depicted positively in the Tepastry.","Eustace remained a powerful figure in Flenders region as the Count of Boulogne until he died in 1087 AD possibly of old age at around 70 years old.",,,,,,,

He was modestly rewarded with chiefdoms in England for his contribution probably due to his young age compared to the other companions. After the invasion, William also participated in many other battles and conflicts including the 1088 rebellion on the side of William II of England. His name was also recorded in the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106 AD fighting for King Henry I as well.","In the later part of his life, his wife, Hervise of Nevers who is the daughter of William the Conqueror, became the regent and ruled in his place. Her rule was reportedly efficient yet too audacious that William II exiled both William and his wife twice, both times due to the complaints by his own noble council. William died in 1118 AD at the age of around 70 years old and was buried in Fontenelle Abbey, Normandy, next to his father's grave.

When his father died in a surprise attack conducted by the Beaumonts, Hugh and his brother, Robert, divided the inheritance. While his brother chose the life of a religious cleric, Hugh inherited his father's estate and focus his life in politic.","Hugh was one of the key noblemen in William of Normandy's court. However, due to unfound paranoia of Hugh's increasing political influence, William banished Hugh in 1058 AD but the two reconciled in 1063 AD. Hugh joined William in the Invasion of England and served as a cavalry commander during the Battle of Hastings where he almost died in combat. Hugh was rewarded greatly with many manors and titles in England.","After the invasion, Hugh remained a prominent political figure in William's court and was part of the council that administrated the kingdom during the king's absence. During this time, Hugh gained more favour from William and was rewarded greatly with even more titles and lands, although he never rose above his rank as a baron, a powerful one nonetheless. Even at old age, Hugh's rule was still rived with conflicts against other Norman nobles. He died of old age on his bed at Leicester in 1094 AD at the age of 66 years old.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

William de Warenne participated in the Battle of Mortemer and became lord of Bellencombre and Mortimer in 1054. He also participated in the Council of Lillebonne and accompanied the Duke in the Invasion of England in 1066 AD.","A capable commander and warrior since a young age, William undoubtedly accomplished significantly in the Battle of Hastings for he was generously rewarded with great amount of lands and holding despite being a minor noble. William later moved his main estate to Castle Acre in Norfolk. His political and monetary power became one of the highest among now King William the Conqueror's court. With lands stretching across England in at least 13 regions.",,"His rule after the invasion was ruthless and expansionist. William was also part of the council noble under Odo of Bayeux and William Fitz 0sbern who administer the country during the King's absence.

Nevertheless, there is a record that the Duke gave Harold Godwinson's corpse to him for burial instead of accepting Harold's mother's gold offers and he was significantly rewarded with lands and wealth for his contribution to the invasion and became Sheriff of Yorkshire.","William Malet (Not to be confused with his grandson of the same name, William Malet) was the son of unnamed Norman father and Saxon mother. It is possible that William was closely related to both William of Normandy and Harold Godwinson according to unverifiable sources. He was also already a somewhat powerful noble in Normandy prior before the Invasion of England. One of the keyholding of Malet house was the Malet Castle at Graville Sainte Honorine.","William Malet was very likely to accompany William of Normandy in the invasion and participate in the Battle of Hastings, reportedly bravely even after he was dismounted.

16,"Odo of Bayeux","Another half-brother of William the Conqueror and older brother of Robert of Mortain. Odo of Bayeux was a cleric turned warrior and Earl of Kent renown for his contribution to the Norman invasion. He was also very likely the person who commissioned Bayeux Tapestry, an immensely important historical relic of propagandistic nature that chronicle the events leading up to the Battle of Hastings. Interestingly his life after the invasion was not a pleasant one. After multiple imprisonments and a failed rebellion, he died on his journey for the First Crusade in Sicily.

He also participated in the Battle of Hastings, leading the Breton contingents on the left side of the army. As a cleric, his presence alone may already boost the morale of the troop significantly, with the affirmation that the church and no doubt, God, are on their side.

During William the conqueror's reign, Odo was the second in power who assist William in court and even served as regent during William's absence. His vast amount of wealth and estates was only second to the king himself.","It is commonly believed that the Bayeux Tapestry was commissioned by Odo to lavishly decorate his cathedral roughly a decade after the invasion. This may explain the mysterious appearance of the three individuals namely, Wadard, Vital and Turold the dwarf servant who were Odo's tenants. The growth of Odo's power and influence came to the abrupt end when William began to view Odo's vast political influence as a threat to his rule.","IMAGE:ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\odo_3.png","                       ","Picture: Turold the dwarf holding a horse in the Bayeux Tapestry","Odo was subjected to two separate imprisonments on the order of William for different charges in 1076 and 1082 AD, both of which caused great loss to his wealth, title, and his formal perceived authority. There can be no doubt that both Odo and William no longer viewed the another with flavour. After being in prison for around five years in Normandy, William, now on his deathbed, released Odo from prison after being persuaded by Robert, Count of Mortain in 1087 AD.","After William's death, Odo supported William's eldest son, Robert Curthose, in the succession rebellion along with Robert, Count of Mortain. The rebellion failed in the end and Odo with permission of William Rufus was allowed to leave England and continued serving Robert Curthose in Normandy.

17,"Turstin FitzRolf","Turstin FitzRolf is the name of a person who was a companion of William the Conqueror. With unknown role and accomplishment, it is more likely that he was a knight under William's service than a minor noble. After the invasion, he was granted multiple Baronies and holdings in Somerset.","Turstin Fitz Rolf (Son of Rolf) or Turstin the White was born around 1045 AD in Bec-de-Mortagne, Normandy. There is not much information regarding his family as we only know that his father name was Rolf as the name of Turstin suggested. Not much else is known about his early life, except that he was a knight under William of Normandy. He was one of the minor nobles that participated in the Invasion of England, either to serve his lord or for wealth and glory.","The story went that as the two formally selected knights, namely Raoul II of Tosny and Walter Giffard, rejected Duke William's offer for the standard-bearer, William called upon Turstin to offer the position. Turstin gladly accepted and bear the standard, which as claimed by the Norman sources was provided by the Pope.

18,"Geoffrey de Montbray","Geoffrey de Montbray was a Bishop from a noble house and a political advisor for William the Conqueror likely both before and after the invasion. He fought in the Battle of Hastings and participated in multiple battles after against the subsequent rebellions. As a religious cleric, the chronicle remarks that Geoffrey was more skilled in the military matter than his official duty.","Geoffrey de Montbray was born around 1030 AD in Montbray, Normandy. He was the son of Roger de Montbray and an unnamed mother. He was made Bishop of Coutances by his brother, Mauger de Montbray, Archbishop of Rouen, in 1049 AD at age 19 years old. To the surprise of nobody, Geoffrey was accused of simony (buying the bishop title) by the Council of Reims. He had to testimony before Pope Leo IX in that same year and with a skilful speech, Pope Leo IX declared Geoffrey innocence of such crime.","After the council, Geoffrey accompanied the pope for about a year and attended the council at Rome in 1050 AD and personally signed the decree (papal bull) that declares Bishop Gerard of Toul as a saint. During his stay in Italy, there are numerous records of Geoffrey meeting with several prominence church officials and nobles, including the infamous Norman adventurer, Robert Guiscard, who conquered Sicily from the occupied Muslims.","Returning from Italy, Geoffrey began the restoration of religious buildings and faith including enacting a new cathedral in his region. Since the beginning of his career, Geoffrey was involved in the political matter in Normandy as well. He was personally close to Duke William of Normandy and help advise in the matter of state multiple times. This is not to say that he disregarded his duty in the spiritual and religious matter though. And in 1066 AD, he accompanied William in his conquest of England.","For commanding the troops in the Battle of Hastings, Geoffrey was rewarded with a great number of lands across England. Even after the invasion, Geoffrey remained a charismatic aristocrat in William's court and actively participated in the political activity of England under William's rule. Moreover, he was also quite active in the matter of warfare, Geoffrey was presented in the siege of Montacute castle in 1069 AD, 1075 rebellion suppression and even joined Robert de Montbray in the succession rebellion.","Although his name was presented in various battles, it was uncertain what was his role in the army or battle. Some records suggest that he and a group of clerics offered a prayer to the troops before the battles. He also served as the advisor to the commander and very likely to directly participated in the combat. Surprisingly, no record of his name was found to hold any title in England after the invasion. This may indicate that Geoffrey remained simply a close advisor for William throughout his rule.","This warrior bishop was one of the leaders in the failed succession rebellion in 1088 AD. After Bishop Odo of Bayeux surrendered to King William II, Geoffrey seemed to manage to reconcile with William rather quickly and fortunately secured all of his wealth and land in England. Although this reconciliation may come at a cost, as his activity in Normandy dwindled significantly in the later years, indicating that Robert Curthose no longer view Geoffrey with favour and the two became hostile.","No longer a prominent figure in both Normandy and England, Geoffrey remained a wealthy individual and still tried to facilitate the matter between both sides as Geoffrey was likely to be presented during the formal peace treaty between William and Robert in Normandy. In 1091 AD, an earthquake stuck Coutances and was famously interpreted as an omen for Geoffrey's death. Geoffrey suddenly fell ill with stomach pain shortly after and was completely incapacitated by the pain.","After recovering from such illness, Geoffrey organised a public confession for his sins and gave alms to the poor. He also ordered the repair for his church and cathedral, while also organised the curse cleansing. Such event was witnessed by many prominent people such as Bishop Odo of Bayeux and Bishop William of Durham. In 1092 AD, Geoffrey died in his deathbed surrounded by clerics and other people. A funeral was performed and his body was buried in his churchyard.",,,,,,,,

He was also the leader of the failed revolt against William II over the succession dispute.","Robert, Count of Mortain was born around 1031 AD, He is the son of Herluin de Conteville and Herleva of Falaise, and younger brother of Odo of Bayeux. As Herleva was also the mother of William of Normandy, this makes Robert the half-brother of William. Robert was made Count of Mortain by William in 1049 after the banishment of the former count, William Wernlenc.

Robert likely presented in the Battle of Hastings although no accomplishment in battle was found. After the successful invasion, Robert was made the Earl of Shrewsbury and rewarded with great wealth and lands.","Robert was indeed a loyal subject of William throughout his life. He was assigned a commander in the defence against Danish invasion in the south, while William the Conqueror marched the royal army to the north in the campaign of so-called ""Harrying of the North"" in 1069 AD. Unlike William, Robert's relationship with Odo remained amiable as he personally requested William to reconciled with Odo when William was in his deathbed. After William's death, Robert joined Odo in the succession crisis in 1088 AD.","Robert was also here in this conflict identified as the key commander of the rebel force along with Odo against William Rufus.

He wore a hauberk armour and equipped with a kite shield and spear while riding a horse. His duty seems to be the logistic supervisor of the army's ration as depicted in the tapestry with nearby farm animals about to be slaughtered and cooked for banquet.","Wadard was likely to be a direct vassal of Odo of Bayeux as support by the evidence of Domesday Book, which shows that he owned lands in Kent, a region that was Odo's main holding. It was also possible that Wadard was already Odo's vassal long before the conquest with the reasoning that his presence in the tapestry was to confirm that Odo brought his own vassals into the war, thus fulfilled his feudal obligation to William.","Regardless of his status or character, Wadard was no doubt an influential patron that either contributed or paid handsomely to Odo to be embroiled into an expensive piece of art unlike any other.

His depiction in the scene indicates that he likely served as a scout platoon leader and heavily armed enough to possibly fought in the cavalry unit during the battle. No formal record existed that write of his deed in battle still.","Possibly a vassal of Odo similar to Wadard long before the invasion, Vital became a landowner tenant in Canterbury, holding at least two estates at Northbourne and Dover. Vital's deed after the invasion was also recorded at the church he established dedicated to St Edmund the Martyr at Ridingate. A pious knight under a wealthy bishop, Vadard and the other followers of Odo were likely one of the more wealthy subjects in the kingdom at the time.","Vital died at some point after the Domesday Book survey in 1088 AD and his son named Haimo inherited his land. Interestingly enough, Vital's family was well-recorded for a minor noble family. Vital also had a daughter named Matilda and another son who became a monk named Goscelin. Goscelin left the Flemish monastery of Saint-Bertin in St-Omer after 1066 AD to settle in England with his family.

According to a Norwegian source, Harold himself rode to Harld and Tostig alone before the battle to convince Tostig to return to his side. The battle began with the English army attempting to cross the bridge, while the Norwegian force start preparing for battle and a lone Norse warrior single-handedly delay the English crossing.","When the English managed to cross the bridge, only a portion of the Norse army managed to form a shield wall and most of them left their armour behind. The battle consisted of the two forces locking in a shield wall engagement for hours. With massive disadvantage, the Norse infantries broke first with both Harald and Tostig killed in the battle subsequently. Although the Norse reinforcement managed to arrive before the battle ended, they were of not much help and could not change the outcome of the battle. ","Although victorious, Harold needed to march his army to the south to fight against the second invasion force led by William. The forced march was so taxing that a good portion of the army was left behind on the way. Upon reaching Hastings, Harold camped his force at Caldbec Hill and his troops held a feast for an entire night to prepare for the upcoming battle. In the early morning, Harold marched his force with the plan to catch William's army off-guard similar to the prior battle but failed. The Battle of Hastings commenced and ended with his death.
