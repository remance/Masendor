"BBL-1","Gilgamesh","Gilgamesh was a legendary hero king of Uruk, a Sumerian city-state that existed around 2000 BC. The record of his life and exploits can be found in the Epic of Gilgamesh poem, which is one of the oldest records that still exist. If the poem is to be believed, he is a demigod offspring from Lugalbanda and Ninsun, the Goddess of wild cows. With the strength that can match mythical creatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOR-1","William of Normandy","William the Bastard, William the Duke of Normandy, William the Conqueror, was the first Norman to rule over England after wrestling the control from the Anglo-Saxon king, Harold Godwinson, in the invasion of England in 1066. From the still young House of Normandy, which ruled over the Normandy region since 911, William was one of the prime contenders whom King Edward the Confessor appoint as his heir. The throne of England is always in his destiny and nothing will stop his rightful conquest.","William of House Normandy, an illegitimate son of Robert I the Magnificent (hence the nickname the Bastard), was born around 1027 AD. He became the Duke of Normandy at the age of 8, but his rise was nothing short of challenging due to his birth status. Many nobles attempted to gain custody of the young duke or organise rebellions to seize the dukedom. With the support of King Henry I of France and many prominent nobles, William managed to consolidate the region of Normandy under his rule in the end.","William first experience in warfare began in the Battle of Varaville, 1047 AD, against a rebellion led by Guy of Burgundy and the fellow conspirators. With the support of King Henry I who personally raised an army of 10,000 strongs to support William's much smaller army, they managed to win against the less organised rebel army, while being outnumbered by at least 2 to 1. The battle ended prematurely after the rebel army became disheartened after losing multiple cavalry skirmishes and broken apart.","After crushing the rebels in the Battle of Varaville, William continuously removed those who threatened his rule in a series of battles and sieges. After his rule of Normandy was firmly in place, William never stopped expanding his influence, which ultimately caused great concern to both the French King, Henry I, and his court. Thus, Henry I and multiple French and Norman nobles marched to seize control of Normandy. Two invasions were attempted, which resulted in the Battle of Mortemer in 1054 AD and the Battle of Varaville in 1057 AD.","With Normandy now under his control, William expanded his control even further with the Invasion of Brittany in 1064 AD, only two years before the England invasion. Although the exact purpose of this invasion is not recorded, William managed to secure the border and also gained many Breton allies who will assist in the upcoming invasion. Additionally, it is with this invasion that multiple Norman-sided sources claim Harold Godwinson assisted William in the invasion and promised to help him secure the throne of England.","Edward the Confessor recently passed away in 1066 AD, and Harold proclaimed himself as King of England. William, who also claimed to receive such a blessing from King Edward, prepared an invasion to claim his rightful throne. Two war councils were called to plan the invasion, and multiple prominent rulers at the time seemed to support the war, including the pope himself. William's army was assembled, and the fleet was constructed in Normandy.","Interestingly, the initial beginning of the invasion did not go well. The strong wind caused a major delay to the invasion, loss of fleet portion and a decrease in morale. This misfortune, however, creates a significant adventurous turn of events for William as King Harald of Norway arrived a few days earlier at the Northumbrian coast. This cause Harold to march his army up north to deal with the Norwegian invasion and allows William's force to land safely at Pevensey Bay with plenty of time to recuperate.","{IMAGE:ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\william_1.png}","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Picture: William holding a feast after fleet landing.","In the Battle of Hastings, William positioned his Conroi knights contingent behind the frontline during the initial phase of the battle. It is very likely that in the melee phase in mid-day, he personally led the charge into the enemy infantry line. If the chronicle is to be believed, William was unhorsed and almost got killed multiple times in battle, which can be the cause of rumour of his death among the troop. At the end of the day, William managed to win against all odds and came out victorious.","{IMAGE:ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\william_2.png}","Picture: William in battle openning his                                        helmet to prove that he was still alive                                       and rally his men.","After the battle, William marched his army to London while also spreading his force to crush the remaining Saxon resistance around the country. Upon reaching London, William ordered the construction of the Tower of London to fortify the capital. He was coronated as the king of England at Westminster Abbey on Christmas day, 1066 AD. The English throne would then no longer be a dream but a reality. This event marked the end of Saxon influence in England and the Norman conquest.","With William as now king, he replaced the old Saxon law and culture with the Norman one. Many former Saxon nobles were replaced with those who accompanied William in the invasion. Unsurprisingly, many remaining Saxon nobles would continue the resistance for the years to come. Even worse, King Sweyn II of Denmark supported the rebellion and mobilised his army for invasion. The resistance would continue for no less than two more decades after the end of the conquest.","William's ruling over England is not much different from his prior approach in Normandy. The constant internal conflicts and rebellion left the country in a constant state of warfare. Not only that, many of his campaigns were considered to be genocidal in nature by many scholars today, though not really uncommon in the Medieval era. Nevertheless, his military achievement is no doubt one of the most deservingly critically acclaimed by historians today.","His story did not conclude elegantly, even in his death. His lifeless body went rotten before the burial ceremony, and it swelled up to the point that it exploded when stuffed inside the coffin. His throne also did not pass on peacefully, for a succession rebellion between his two sons occurred only one year after. The rule of his son (Rufus, the one who won), too ended tragically with an arrow to the chest.",
"NOR-2","Alan the Red","Alan Rufus, or ""the Red (beard)"", was a Breton nobleman and close companion of William the Conqueror. As part of the Invasion of England, he is the commander of the Breton forces in William's army. After the successful invasion, Alan was granted amass fortune and the title Earl of Richemont and remained an important figure in William's court and ruling achievement, which later on allowed him to become one of the wealthiest individuals in Europe.","Alan Rufus (the Red), son of Eudon (Odo) of Brittany and Orguen, was born around 1040 AD in Brittany. He was from the House of Rennes and a relative of William the Bastard. Evident records seem to suggest that Alan was William's companion and held a sizable amount of lands and estates long before the Invasion of England. However, not much else is known about Rufus in his early life before the Battle of Hastings, but much of his legacies still live on to this day.","{IMAGE:ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\alan_1.png}","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Picture: William the Conqueror granting the charter with a green pendant seal representing lordship of Richmondshire to Alan Rufus.","Alan's accomplishment in the Battle of Hastings was noteworthy indeed. He was a commander for one of the Breton contingents, probably the infantry lines, and he was commended for merit in battle by various chronicles. For his contribution to the battle, Alan was greatly rewarded with a vast amount of wealth and lands in central England, similar to other of William's prominent companions. Alan remained a loyal subject of the Norman English throne until the end.","After the invasion, Alan participated in the quelling of the Saxon rebellion in 1069 AD. Although unclear what kind of role he had in the conflict, Alan was rewarded the Honour of Richmond, the region of Yorkshire. There Alan built Richmond Castle in 1071 AD, which still stands to this day, albeit as a ruin that reflects only the glory of its former self. As time went by, Alan's wealth and power grew larger. By 1086 AD, Alan Rufus was one of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in England.","{IMAGE:ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\alan_2.png}","             ","Picture: Watercolour of Richmond Castle in the late 18th century, by Paul Sandby and William Taverner.","In the later part of his life, Alan participated in various internal conflicts and the civil war on the side of the royal throne. Even in the rebellion in 1088 AD, Alan supported William II to protect the throne against Robert Curthose, William's eldest son. Victorious in various battles and contributed greatly to the war effort, Alan remained powerful in the English court, possibly only second to the king himself, unlike many other former companions of William.","Alan Rufus died suddenly and somewhat mysteriously, either in 1090 or 1093 AD, of an unknown cause. His body was buried in an abbey at Bury St Edmunds, an eventful region on its own. Without children, Alan's brother, Alan Niger (the Black), inherited the title and treasure of the wealthiest individual in English history and remained as the second lord until his, too, inevitable death.",,,,,,
"NOR-3","William FitzOsbern","William fitzOsbern was a cousin and close companion of William the Conqueror. He was a nobleman who ruled over Breteuil, Normandy, before becoming Earl of Hereford and Essex after the Norman conquest. After the invasion, he remained one of the most important political figures in Norman England, while his name became and is still renowned for many castles that he commissioned. He met his end in the Battle of Cassel while pursuing the wealth of Flanders principality.","William FitzOsbern was born in 1020 AD, son of Osbern, the seneschal of Normandy and Emma of Ivry. His family served the Duke of Normandy for generations and was a close relative to the House of Normandy. With his father murdered in 1040, William FitzOsbern became the next seneschal for William the Bastard and one of the closest advisors to the duke. It is believed that being the most zealous supporter of the Invasion of England, he was the one that persuaded the opposition nobles to join the invasion.","With the successful conquest and as one of the leading figures in the invasion, William FitzOsbern was generously rewarded and granted the lordship over the Isle of Wight and Hereford to already many land-ownership under his rule. The promise of peace was still not in sight for England as the region near Wales (commonly called The Welsh Marches) was still under threat from the hostile Welsh Kingdom. William FitzOsbern was assigned as the chief strategist to create a new type of stone castle to defend the border.","{IMAGE:ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\ozborn_1.png}","                                                                                                                                                                                               Many stone castles did he build, and still standing until this day, William became one of the major Norman castle builders. One of them is Chepstow Castle in the southeast of Wales, which is now the oldest stone castle that is still standing today in Britain, as seen in the picture above.","William became one of the most prominent political figures in the Norman court. He was assigned the commander of the royal army and in charge of many regions, both as the regent and governor. The tales of this famed castle builder do not have a pleasant ending, however, as William saw an opportunity over the now contesting Flanders region. He decided to marry the widowed Countess Richilde and rushed to her aid in the succession dispute conflict.","William joined the Battle of Cassel with a group of Norman Conrois against Robert I of Flanders in February 1071 AD. Both Arnulf III, the leader of the army, and William were killed in the surprise attack organised by Robert. His estates and wealth were then divided among his two sons, William and Roger FitzOsbern.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOR-4","Eustace II","Eustace II was a Count of Boulogne who fought in the Battle of Hastings. He was one of the commanders that led the charge of Norman Knights and was struck by a battle-axe from Saxon Huscarl in the battle. After the invasion, Eustace rebelled against William the Conqueror due to the dissatisfaction of war spoil and possibly for a claim on the English throne. The rebellion ultimately failed, but William and Eustace reconciled with Eustace retaining some of his holdings and remaining in William's court.","Eustace II (Nickname Eustace with moustaches) was born between the year 1015 and 1018 AD, son of Eustace I of Boulogne and Matilda of Louvaine. He participated in the failed rebellion in 1033 AD against Henry III, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and was excommunicated by Pope Leo IX in 1049 AD for marrying his second wife, Ida of Lorraine, a close relative to Eustace after his first wife died a decade ago. Eustace also became the Count of Boulogne as his father died in the same year.","In 1051 AD, Eustace visited Edward the Confessor, who was his relative and ally. A simple visit created a turn of events when Eustace and his retinue somehow got into a brawl with the people of Dovers. A minor event that led to the rebellion and exile of House Godwinson later on. Eustace joined Duke William of Normandy in the Invasion of England and seemed to be one of the important commanders in the army. His role in the battle was noteworthy in many chronicles.","{IMAGE:ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\eustace_1.png}","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Picture: Eustace in the battle pointing at Duke William and yelling to the troop that William is still here and alive.","As the battle turned worse for the Norman side, the Norman record writes that as Eustace was about to retreat with his knights, Duke William's reinforcement arrived at the central engagement. Eustace advised the Duke that the army should withdraw but was ignored. As the fight continued, Eustace was struck in the face by a Saxon soldier, which caused blood to gush from his mouth and nose. Nevertheless, Eustace survived the battle.","Although Eustace joined William in the invasion, many pieces of evidence seem to suggest that this is not out of loyalty and friendship. It is also possible that Eustace looked down on William for being a bastard with commoner blood while he was part of the illustrated House of Flanders. This matter reinforces the fact that Eustace's role in battle varied widely in different chronicles. Some depict him as a coward, while others depict him as a competent warrior and commander.","After the invasion, Eustace was granted rewards and lands for his contribution to the invasion and returned to his holding in Boulogne. In 1067 AD, Eustace launched an attack on Odo of Bayeux's castle in Dover, which ultimately failed. The reason for the attack is not clear, some suggest that it is rebellion against William for being unsatisfied with the amount of reward from the invasion, while others suggest he was ""requested"" by his Englishmen allies who also joined the siege.","Eustace managed to flee from the failed rebellion back to Boulogne. He was stripped of his title and lordship in England when William heard of the rebellion. William later forgave Eustace and returned some of the confiscated lands soon later. Many scholars also suggest that it was Eustace who commisioned the Bayeux Tepastry and presented it to Odo of Bayeux to make amend for trying to attack Dover castle. This would explained why Eustace was depicted positively in the Tepastry.","Eustace remained a powerful figure in the Flanders region as the Count of Boulogne until he died in 1087 AD, possibly of old age at around 70 years old.",,,,,,,

Later on in his life, William inherited Count of Evreux from his father and participated in many battles, like the Battle of Tinchebray under King Henry I.","William of Evreux was born around 1046 AD in Evreux, son of Archbishop Richard of Evreux and Godchildis. Not much is known about his early life except that he was a prominent Norman noble who participated in the Invasion of England. William and his father participated in the Council at Lillebonne and contributed around 80 transport ships to the invasion fleet. Although not explicitly mentioned, it was very likely that William also fought in the Battle of Hastings.","With the retirement of his father in 1066 AD, William succeeded as the Count of Evreux the next year after the invasion. He was modestly rewarded with chiefdoms in England for his contribution, probably due to his young age compared to the other companions of William the Conqueror. After the invasion, William also participated in many other battles and conflicts, including the 1088 rebellion on the side of William II of England. His name was also recorded in the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106 AD, fighting for King Henry I.","In the later part of his life, his wife, Hervise of Nevers, who is the daughter of William the Conqueror, became the regent and ruled in his place. Her rule was reportedly efficient yet too audacious that William II exiled both William and his wife twice, both times due to complaints by his own noble council. William died in 1118 AD at the age of around 70 years old and was buried in Fontenelle Abbey, Normandy, next to his father's grave.

In 1107 AD, Henry I of England created the title of Earl of Leicester and granted the title to Robert, making him the first Earl of Leicester in history, which would be inherited by his family for generations to come. Later on, Robert was excommunicated by Pope Paschal II in 1105 AD for his role in investiture (instalment freedom of bishop by the state/king instead of the Pope) in England.","Robert was highly praised in the chronicle for being a wise learned man. An advisor to three Norman Kings, starting from William the Conqueror, William's son William Rufus, and then King Henry. Robert was the last living Norman noble that fought in the Battle of Hastings to die in 1118 AD at the age of around 70 years old.

He was the son of Roger of Montbray and an unnamed mother. He was made Bishop of Coutances by his brother, Mauger of Montbray, Archbishop of Rouen, in 1049 AD at age 19 years old. To the surprise of nobody, Geoffrey was accused of simony (buying the bishop title) by the Council of Reims. He had to testimony before Pope Leo IX in that same year and with a skilful speech, Pope Leo IX declared Geoffrey innocence of such crime.","After the council, Geoffrey accompanied the pope for about a year and attended the council at Rome in 1050 AD and personally signed the decree (papal bull) that declares Bishop Gerard of Toul as a saint. During his stay in Italy, there are numerous records of Geoffrey meeting with several prominence church officials and nobles, including the infamous Norman adventurer, Robert Guiscard, who conquered Sicily from the occupied Muslims.","Returning from Italy, Geoffrey began the restoration of religious buildings and faith including enacting a new cathedral in his region. Since the beginning of his career, Geoffrey was involved in the political matter in Normandy as well. He was personally close to Duke William of Normandy and help advise in the matter of state multiple times. This is not to say that he disregarded his duty in the spiritual and religious matter though. And in 1066 AD, he accompanied William in his conquest of England.","For commanding the troops in the Battle of Hastings, Geoffrey was rewarded with a great number of lands across England.

Moreover, he was also quite active in the matter of warfare, Geoffrey was presented in the siege of Montacute castle in 1069 AD, 1075 rebellion suppression and even joined Robert of Montbray in the succession rebellion.","Although his name was presented in various battles, it was uncertain what was his role in the army or battle. Some records suggest that he and a group of clerics offered a prayer to the troops before the battles. He also served as the advisor to the commander and very likely to directly participated in the combat. Surprisingly, no record of his name was found to hold any title in England after the invasion. This may indicate that Geoffrey remained simply a close advisor for William throughout his rule.","This warrior bishop was one of the leaders in the failed succession rebellion in 1088 AD. After Bishop Odo of Bayeux surrendered to King William II, Geoffrey seemed to manage to reconcile with William rather quickly and fortunately secured all of his wealth and land in England. Although this reconciliation may come at a cost, as his activity in Normandy dwindled significantly in the later years, indicating that Robert Curthose no longer view Geoffrey with favour and the two became hostile.","No longer a prominent figure in both Normandy and England, Geoffrey remained a wealthy individual and still tried to facilitate the matter between both sides as Geoffrey was likely to be presented during the formal peace treaty between William and Robert in Normandy. In 1091 AD, an earthquake stuck Coutances and was famously interpreted as an omen for Geoffrey's death. Geoffrey suddenly fell ill with stomach pain shortly after and was completely incapacitated by the pain.","After recovering from such illness, Geoffrey organised a public confession for his sins and gave alms to the poor. He also ordered the repair for his church and cathedral, while also organised the curse cleansing.

With his father death at around 1047 AD, Odo inherit all of the titles from his father. These holdings were later usurped by his own uncle, Theobald III of Blois.","With no holding, Odo took refuge in the William of Normandy court and married Adelaide of Normandy in 1060 AD, the daughter of Robert I, Duke of Normandy and a recent widow to Lambert II, Count of Lens and Enguerrand II, Count of Ponthieu, both of who were killed in a battle one year following each other. Odo, at the age of 20, married his close cousin, who was at the age of 30, although uncommon to the noble standard at the time, should still be controversial and forbidden according to the Catholic church.","Legend said that Odo, in his escape to William's court, killed ""a magnate of his own country"". Since such escape would occur when Odo was nothing more than a mere child or teen, he must be a fine warrior. At the age of 25, Odo likely (unconfirmed) joined William of Normandy in the Invasion of England and the Battle of Hastings. However, there was no apparent record that Odo received any holding reward in England from the conqueror after the war. Interestingly, only his wife was rewarded with lands and the title ""Comitissa of Albemarle"".","History is mostly silent on his activity during the reign of William the Conqueror. Only we know for sure that He bored a son named,  Stephen, and Odo was actively involved in the civil war between the two sons of William after the conqueror's death. On the side of William II Rufus, he was awarded the Castle of Aumale. With the civil war won, this Odo and 5 other discontented nobles conceived a plot to install Robert (Odo's son) as the King of England. William Rufus was aware of such a plot and ordered the arrest of both Odo and Robert.","The father was thrown into prison with a term of a lifetime, and the son was to be blinded. The son was spared from such punishment with the appeal from his family (not to forget that they are relative to the king himself) and generous reparation payments. Odo remained in prison until the end of his life, all of his titles stripped and lands confiscated. The lands were returned to his son only after the death of William Rufus. Thus end the life of another Norman noble who strive to obtain the highest but end up with nothing.",,,,,,,,,,,

Robert and his son were presented during the War Council at Lillebonne that convened on the invasion. The matter of his being at the battle itself is still that of debating topic among scholars as he died of old age the year after.","Richard of Évreux, the eldest son of four from Robert II Archbishop of Rouen, Count of Évreux and Herleva. He obtained the count title from his father at the age of 15. He was married to a woman named, Godechildis. A pious man who supported the abbey of Jumi’ges, Sainte-Trinit’ of Rouen, and the abbey of Saint-Taurin in donations. Not much is known of his life compared to his son, William of Évreux.","Of what history we know, Richard married his wife Godehildis (or Adelaide) Ramon in 1040 AD, the widow of Roger I of Tosny, who died around 1025 AD. Richard had 3 children one son and two daughters. The son is, as mentioned before with the name, William of Evreux. As one of the powerful Norman noble families, Richard and his eldest son participated in the Invasion of England. The Évreux family contributed 80 ships to the invasion, and this information can still be seen in the record. No apparent evidence seems to suggest Richard's presence on the battlefield, but it would be no unusual for this father to fight alongside his son for the glory of the family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOR-28","Baldwin FitzGilbert","Baldwin FitzGilbert, or Baldwin the Sheriff, was one of the wealthy and influential Norman noblemen during the time of William the Conqueror's reign. Baldwin held the largest number of manors in Devon and was titled Sheriff of Devon, all of which were likely to be rewarded for his deed during the invasion in which he and his older brother, Richard FitzGilbert, participated.","Baldwin FitzGilbert, the younger son of  Gilbert, Count of Brionne, was born around 1032 at Meulles, Normandy. Not much is known of his early life, but it is very likely that he and his older brother, Richard FitzGilbert, joined William of Normandy in the Invasion of England and fought in the Battle of Hastings. He also participated in the following series of sieges against the remaining Saxon lords that resisted William's rule after the battle. For his deeds, Baldwin was awarded many lands and castles in Devon.","The Rougemont Castle or Exeter Castle was the primary holding of this Sheriff of Devon, the title which he held until his death. His name can be seen in the Domesday book as Baldwin the Viscount. Baldwin was married to Albreda (Emma), who was a cousin of William the Conqueror. A father to 3 sons, 2 daughters, and 1 illegitimate son.

"NOR-29","Gerbod the Fleming","Gerbod the Fleming was a Frankish noble (tenants-in-chief) from Flanders. He participated in the Battle of Hastings and was rewarded the Earl of Chester title. However, the man had no shortage of misfortune. He lost a portion of his holdings due to a series of political events in the same year and the Earl title after he was captured by his enemies in the Battle of Cassel in Flanders. His fate became uncertain afterwards, some said he escaped from captivity and became a monk, while others said he died a prisoner.","Gerbod the Fleming, or Gherbod of St.Omer, was born around 1030 AD from a father of the same name, a hereditary advocate of the abbey of Saint-Bertin. The son inherited the lands in Flanders after his father's death. He joined William of Normandy in the Invasion of England and possibly the battle that ended Harold Godwinson, although no solid evidence can be found to support this assumption. ","After the invasion, Gerbod was awarded the lands in Chester with the newly created title Earl of Chester, while His sister, Gundred of St. Omer, was married to William of Warenne and became the Countess of Surrey. Gerbod rule in Chester was not an easy one as the English and Welsh lords alike continuously raided the earldom and caused troubles to no end. For whatever reason, Gerbod travelled back to Flander in 1070 AD. He joined in the Flander civil war after the death of Baldwin VI the Good, Count of Flanders.","Fought on the side of Robert I of Flanders, Gerbod participated in the Battle of Cassel in 1071 AD. Two stories remained about his fate after the battle. The first is that although the battle was won, Gerbod was captured by the French and died in prison at some later time. The second says that Gerbod himself slain Arnulf III, Count of Flanders and fled to Rome to seek atonement for this killing. Regardless of the story, his absence made William the Conqueror transfer the unoccupied Earldom of Chester to  Hugh of Avranches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOR-30","Ralph of Gael","This was an English and Breton-born noble who led the last revolt of the earls against William of Normandy, the very last resistant of remaining Saxon lords against the encroaching grasp of Norman power in England. Ralph (Radulf) of Gael was a former ally of William and was likely to fight in the Battle of Hastings on the side of the Norman. Brave and confident, his resistant to William's rule lasted until the death of William himself.","Ralph of Gael, or Radulf Waders, was born around 1040 AD. Son of an English Earl father and Breton mother. He lived his childhood in England under the reign of Edward the Confessor. Not much else is recorded, only that he accompanied William of Normandy in his conquest of England and inherited the old holdings from his father. His holdings include estates in Norfolk and regions in West England. The Domesday book seems to suggest that he was one of the most influential lords in William's court.","Besides the invasion, Ralph was involved in various conflicts throughout his life. From the siege of the castle of Combourg in 1066 AD to the defence against Norsemen raiding Norfolk in 1069 AD. He married Emma, the only daughter of William FitzOsbern, in 1075 AD. Such marriage would unite the two of the most powerful English noble houses. This bold move did not elude William's political insight, for he rejected to sanction such marriage.","With William's absence in England, Ralph proceeded with the marriage anyway and, at the wedding feast, conspired with the two Saxon lords, his new brother-in-law Roger of Breteuil and Waltheof of Northumberland, to revolt against William's rule. The plan suffered a massive setback when Waltheof confessed to Lanfranc, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The archbishop then informed William the Conqueror and dissuaded Roger from the revolt. Waltheof was imprisoned and executed a year later by the order of William himself.","The execution later triggered another unrest and revolt by the English people, as Waltheof was beloved by many. With two primary conspirators gone, the revolt Ralph planned could not be executed. With the pursuit of Odo of Bayeux and Geoffrey of Montbray, Ralph fled to Denmark to call for aid while his wife stayed at Norwich to defend the castle. With the help of King Svend of Denmark, Ralph sailed back to England with 200 warships with prince Knud and Jarl Hakon. Ralph could not arrived in time as the Norwich castle surrendered, and his wife escaped to Brittany.","As revenge, Ralph and his Norseman friends pillaged the English lands and destroyed Norman Cathedral St Peter's Minster. Ralph later met with his wife in Brittany and continued to rule his remaining holdings. William, with his determination to crush all those who oppose him, summoned a fleet to invade Ralph's barony. With assistance from the King of France, Ralph drove William back to England with a crushing victory in 1077 AD. Although the two made peace, only after William's death could Ralph travel back to England in 1093 AD. ",,,,,,,,,,,

A noble of birth, nevertheless, was a vassal of Duke William of Normandy. He participated in the Battle of Mortemer in 1054 AD against the Kingdom of France.

Originally the Earl of East Anglia, Harold was already extremely influential person long before his kingship. His short reign of one year as the last Saxon king was nothing short of troubling, having to defend against both invasions from Norse and Norman in the same year. He and his two brothers were killed in the Battle of Hastings thus signal the new reign of Norman in Albion.","Harold II of house Godwinson, son of Godwin of Wessex and Gytha, was born in 1022 AD. House Godwinson was already one of the most powerful families in England, controlling the majority of the south-eastern part of the country. In 1044 AD, his father obtained and bestowed the Earldom of East Angelia to him. Harold also married Edith the Fair at around this time, the marriage was considered to be controversial as many scholars still debated whether the church considered it to be illegitimate or not.","In 1051 AD, Harold's father rebelled against Edward the Confessor for refusing to obey the royal decree to punish the people of Dover who attack Eustace II during his visit. The rebellion failed and his whole family was exiled from England in the same year. Harold and his younger brother, Leofwine, fled to Dublin while the rest of the family sought refuge in Flender. A year later, Harold and his family returned to England with an army and forced Edward to restore the lost earldom to his father, thus restoring the power of Godwinson.","After his father died suddenly in 1053 AD, Harold inherit the Earldom of Wessex and became the most powerful political figure in England, second only to the king himself. In 1057 AD, the death of Leofric and other political rivals allowed Harold to obtained the Earldom of Mercia and Northumbria for his two younger brothers. Godwinson family was no doubt the most powerful house in Saxon England at the time. Even more so as Harold also strengthen the alliance with other powerful Saxon nobles.","Harold also emerge victorious against the Welsh multiple times both in defensive and offensive campaigns, which strengthened his political position even further. In 1064 AD, the Norman chronicle recounted that Harold was sent by Edward to inform William the Bastard of the decision to make William the King of England. The ship Harold was on then got shipwrecked and he got captured by William's vassal. Harold was later released and welcomed by William at the Normandy's court.","With Edward's death In 1066 AD, Harold claimed that Edward on his deathbed appointed Harold as the ""protector"" of the kingdom. Harold was then elected as King in the noble council meeting the following day after.
