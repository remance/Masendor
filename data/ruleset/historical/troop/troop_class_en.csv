"Class","Strengths","Weaknesses","Description"
"Heavy Infantry","Great Melee, Great Defence","Slow Movement","The key player of most armies in the old history. They held the line for cavalries to flank the enemies, take rain of arrows and bullets head-on, and charge the enemies first if need be. Equipped with heavy armour, weapon and shield, few can match them in a direct engagement. Their purpose became diminished with the advent of modern firearms that can penetrate most armours."
"Light Infantry","Decent Melee, Versatile, Fast","Bad Defence","Light infantry is the bare bone of ancient warfare that can be used for all types of roles. Most of the time, light infantry troops make up the majority of the soldiers in an army, as heavy armours were too expensive to equip troops in large numbers. Never underestimate even the lowest light infantries, and you will live long enough to be the master of the battlefield."
"Range Infantry","Great Skirmisher","Very Bad Melee and Defence","Range infantry may not yet be the dominant force in the past compare to the present time, it can still tip the scale of victory during the skirmish phase of the battle or in siege warfare. Typically weak in melee combat, it is not advisable to put them in the frontline unless the enemy is incapable of pulling a significant melee charge. "
"Range Cavalry","Fast, Good Skirmisher","Bad Melee","The greatest tool of the conquerors of the known world. Fast and vicious, range cavalry is an unmatched force in the flat plain. As long as they do not fight in unsuitable terrain or situation or engage in unfavourable melee combat, it is almost impossible to destroy them. "
"Light Cavalry","Very Fast, Versatile","Low Defence","Light cavalry has many roles, either scouting, skirmishing, harassing or pursuing fleeing enemies. They are less suited for direct melee combat however, so use their superb mobility to avoid losing them in a pointless fight."
"Heavy Cavalry","Great in Melee Combat, Great Charge, High Defence","Slow for Cavalry","Heavy or shock cavalry is the domination force in the old battlefield. Their charge can pierce through even shield wall. The only few downsides are that they are slower than lighter cavalry and much more difficult to employ in the field in large number."
"Chariot","Fast, Great Charge","High Terrain Penalty","Chariot used to be master of the battlefield before the invention of cavalry. Although less used now, their presence can still instil fear into the enemy while crushing through enemy squads. Chariot unit usually also carry range weapon with a good amount of ammunition, which make it a decent skirmish unit as well."
"Artillery","Long Range, High Damage","Very Slow, No Melee","Artillery exists in many forms depending on its use. Some artilleries are more effective against infantry units such as scorpion or hwacha, while some others are more suitable for damaging structure or siege warfare likes trebuchet."
