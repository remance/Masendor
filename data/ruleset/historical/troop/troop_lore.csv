6,"Norman Conrois were the elite knights of the Norman army. They were partially organised professional soldiers who received training in the art of warfare since the coming of age. They typically operated and trained in a group of around 50 men. These knights were excellently disciplined and excel in both melee charging and skirmishing tactics due to the influence from the Frank and Breton neighbours' cavalry mastery.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\war\lore_image\conroi_1.png","   ","Picture of Norman Conrois charging in Bayeux Tapestry.","Norman Conrois were armed with several melee weapons similar to medieval knights. Their main weapon was a leaf shape lance similar to Kontos lance but with a much shorter length. The Bayeux Tapestry also shows a picture of Conrois using a wooden club and sword as a secondary weapon. Due to a shorter length of the lance, Coirois were less of a shock cavalry unit and more of heavy melee one. This is also likely why William ordered the frontal cavalry charge against the shield wall directly.","For the protection, they were equipped with chainmail hauberk and coif under a steel helmet similar to other European heavy cavalries at the time. In the off-hand, Conrois used a wooden kite shield, which provides great protection to the whole body on the venerable side and incoming missile attack. Their protective gears were made with no less than the state of the art technology available at the time.",,"Unlike other Norse descendants, the Norman army introduced the employment of heavy cavalry unit as a frontline shock troop due to the influence of their neighbours. Their equestrian skill was no doubt one of the best exemplars of early European knights. Interestingly, the Bayeux Tapestry frequently portrays Conrois holding their spear overhead in combat, which may indicate that their combat technique was maybe significantly different than the common couch lance stance used by other European cavalries. ","Although it is not clearly recorded which breed of warhorse the Conrois ride on, the portrayal of warhorse in Bayeux Tapestry demonstrates several intrigue aspects. The horses' bodies are very thick, muscular and much larger than what would be the leaner Arabian horse breed. Their heads are also disproportionately smaller than the body and the mane are short. It is much likely that the horses were of European breed, possibly the ancestor breed of Percheron horse, which also inhabit in the French region. ",

26,"Saxon Huscarls or Húskarlar were household bodyguards and retainers for Medieval Scandinavian culture. Tradionally, they were free men (unlike thralls and slaves) that served their lord in various tasks. The roles of Huscarls differ depending on the culture. For example, English or Saxon Huscarls duty ranged from civil administrative to the military, while Scadinavian Huscarls also refer to manservants of noble. ","The Huscarls nevertheless played an important role as elite heavy infantries in the Saxon armies during the time High Medieval period. Often compared to the legendary Jomsvikings in the old writing, it is believed that Huscarls were even more organised and highly paid by their contractors. They maintain yearly contracts with their employers and are free to leave at any time. The Huscarl order has its own code of law and organisation similar to those of the Medieval guilds.",,,,,,,,
