19,"Units","The unit in this game can be in any larger number from Battalion to Division or even as low as Squadron. Because such standardisation of a military unit does not concretely exist in the Medieval period and the record of army organisation and deployment in the historical battles are often ambiguous, the unit deployment can only be accurate as the detail of the record and gameplay limitation.",,,"Unit is a group of sub-unit that can be directly controlled by the user. Each unit requires a minimum number of 10 sub-units at the start of the battle and can have up to 64 sub-unit maximum."
20,"Sub-Unit","Historically, sub-unit can be in various number from squad to depending on the army organisation that the country utilise.",,,"Sub-unit represent a group of soldiers of the same type. Sub-unit cannot be employed by itself into battle alone and require to be employed as a unit. "

22,"Troop Number",,,,"Troop number represents how many soldiers exist in the unit and sub-unit at the time. The number is presented as ""Current Number (Maximum Number)"". Troop number can also represent the health state of the unit. The more troop number gets reduced, the less damage the unit can deal in combat. If the troop number reaches 0, the squad or battalion will be considered as destroyed."
23,"Stamina",,,,"Stamina represents the troops’ current capacity to perform physical activities. Each activity requires a specific amount of stamina to performed and drain stamina at different rate whether it be simply walking or using a special ability. Units’ stamina can be replenished by simply staying still or with some abilities. Noted that if troops’ stamina reaches 0, it will enter collapse state and become unable to perform any task for a while until their stamina reach a certain recovering point."
24,"Grade","Each sub-unit grade also interact with the battalion main leader's social class differently. For more detail on this aspect, see Subsection Leader Social Class","There are 11 classification of unit grade as shown in the table below with the modification to the unit statistic;","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\lore\image\gradetable.png","Grade represents the training level of the troops. While some grades typically are the consecutive improvement of one another, there are some that are a special class of its own, which are Noble, Mercenary, and Religious Warrior."
25,"Discipline",,,,"Discipline represents the state of order among the troops. In order for a large group of people to perform a task in unison, discipline is one of the most crucial factors.

Discipline also affect other stats such as morale and combat stats."
26,"Morale",,,,"Morale represents the unit’s current state of eagerness to fight in battle. The more morale the unit have, the better they can perform in battle. "
27,"Combat Statistic",,,,"Each sub-unit possess a different combat capability that is presented in the form of combat statistics such as melee attack or speed. These statistics represent how well the sub-unit can perform specific tasks. For example, a sub-unit with a high melee attack but low melee defence is well suited for a flanking attack rather than a frontal assault. "
28,"Skill","Skills often require a specific amount of stamina and discipline to be activated. Sub-units will not use skill if either of their discipline or stamina does not meet the requirement. ",,,"Each sub-unit usually possess a specific set of skill it can perform. Each skill has a specific condition, cooldown, duration and effect. While the player cannot activate the units’ skill directly, it is possible to set a specific behaviour for each battalion between reserving the uses of skills or using them as often as possible. For example, one of the most common skill is “Charge” where a squad uses during running to attack its enemy. Charge skill allows the units to temporally boost their melee combat efficiency and also use special stat “Charge Power”, which increase the damage for a short duration. Charge skill cannot be activated if the units are already in melee combat."

A well-equipped sub-unit is always better than the ill-equipped one regardless of their own statistic. The equipment also has a weight that slows down the sub-unit movement speed."
32,"Leader",,,,"A leader is a person who leads a unit into battle. At least one leader is always required for a unit to be combat effective. The overall combat effectiveness of a unit is directly affected by its leader skill, which exists in two categories: Authority and command.

In the command battalion, the commander will have one bodyguard squad that represent him in the battlefield. If that squad is destroyed, the commander will be considered as dead. The position of the bodyguard squad in the battalion also affect the authority as the leader who lead their troops at the front will assure confidence in his leadership, while leading from the back guarantee his safety but is often viewed as cowardice.

The position of the sub-general's squads do not affect the authority until they become general. Additionally, sub-generals can also use their unique abilities in the same way as general."
38,"Special",,,,"Special advisor is considered the bishop of an army. Although having the least important role in the battalion, special advisor can bring additional benefit to the battalion that may change the course of battle. The special advisor also has his own squad in the battalion but can provides only 25\% of the leader's authority and do not provide any benefit from the command ability at all. However, their special ability can still be used in the same way as general and sub-general, this make the role suitable for leaders that have good or unconventional ability but lousy command or authority. Nevertheless, special advisor will become general only if there are no general and sub-general left, so choose wisely who to be employed in special advisor role. "

Weather can dynamically change during the battle and affect sub-units in a different way. Weather also has a level of strength that further indicates its exact characteristic. For example, light rain may not has many effects on sub-units besides causing a wet status effect compared to heavy rain, which greatly reduces range combat capability and quickly causes a drench status effect."
