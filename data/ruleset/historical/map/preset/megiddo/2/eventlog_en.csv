"t0",0,"Unlike many other modern historians, Spalinger is a bit more conservative in the estimation of the number of soldiers that participated in the battle. He describes his theory in detail of how the Pharoah army would march from Sile to Gaza to Yehem and finally to Megiddo using Aruna Pass. The march is estimated to begin at the beginning of April, which was the time when the farmers finished harvesting the grain crops as supplies for the campaign.","08:00:00"
"t1",0,"Spalinger estimates the troop number using the path's distance and the time it took for the Egyptian army to travel based on the record, which mentioned that for the travelling through the Aruna Pass in a single-file formation, the first Egyptian troop in the front only managed to exit the pass when the last at the rear managed to enter it. The pass's distance is about 800 metres, and the entire Egyptian army took about 80 minutes to traverse.","08:15:00"
"t2",0,"Aside from the troop number, Spalinger also question many other aspects of the record, from the date of the battle to the fact that the Egyptian army could finish travelling through Aruna Pass unseen and set camp to rest until the next morn. As the Canaanite coalition was caught unprepared for this battle with the Egyptian's unorthodox travelling method, he raised the most important question: why would the Pharoah allow his enemy to muster the troop for a whole day instead of launching a surprise attack.","08:30:00"
"t3",0,"As the remaining records of the battle are indeed sparse and there are many conflicting accounts, no modern scholars can truly give a definitive answer. The only plausible fact is that the battle took place near the city itself, which gave time for the retreating Canaanite infantries and chariot warriors to flee into the city on foot in time after the combat.","08:45:00"
"t4",0,"For the battle itself, Spalinger could only accredit the victory of the Egyptian to either the superior number and quality of soldiers or the leadership of the commanders, which is to say, there may still be other unknown factors involved in the battle and campaign that are impossible to perceive in our modern time.","10:00:00"
"t5",0,"As the records go, the battle ended with Thutmose III's decisive victory. Thus end his majesty's first battle and began his impressive series of campaigns against the Levant nations to secure the largest empire at the time.","11:00:00"
"ld0","L36","What would happen if Thutmose lost his life in this battle? Would the Pharoah's almighty troops continue the fight and avenge their leader? Or would they flee back into the Aruna Pass and escape underneath the desert night? Only one thing is certain. The New Kingdom is likely to encounter a civil war and collapse from the lack of a direct heir. ",
"ld1","L37","The death of the King of Kadesh is unlikely to change the course of the battle itself. However, his head in evidence may help hasten the surrender of the Megiddo that lasted through a lengthy siege and thus altered the course of history.",
