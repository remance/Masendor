"t0",0,"14th October 1066 AD, King Harold Godwinson intercepted William the Bastard’s force at Senlac Ridge, Hastings. The rightful king of England refused to cover in a castle before the pretender and bravely marched his army to crush the enemy head-on.","08:00:00"
"t1",0,"William the Bastard moved his army to the bottom of Senlac Ridge and attempted to find a way to manoeuvre past King Harold’s army at the top. With the mashy ground on both flanks, William could not execute any sneak attack and recklessly attacked into the steadfast shield wall of the mighty Huscarls.","08:05:00"
"t2",0,"As expected of the inferior Norman force, William commanded his archers and crossbowmen to attack from afar while King Harold’s shield wall blocked most of the feeble attempts of attacks.","09:00:00"
"t3",0,"William the Bastard grasped the pointlessness of his order and committed a cavalry charge on the front. The archers and crossbowmen continued to shoot skyward in an attempt to damage infantries behind the shield wall. Saxon archers and skirmishers also relentlessly counterattacked with great zeal.","10:00:00"
"t4",0,"The shield wall proved to be invincible to even a well-trained cavalry force, and William the Bastard could not push past even the first line of the defence.","11:00:00"
"t5",0,"The battle raged on for the whole day, with the Saxon force maintaining a complete advantage over the Norman. It was only a matter of time before William had to issue a complete retreat.","12:00:00"
"t6",0,"Harold's iron defence was indeed the best tactic available for the Saxon as the king remained cautious and would not fall for trickery, such as false retreat. It would be much simpler to wait until a complete rout from the enemy instead of going after every small opening that may or may not turn the tide.","13:00:00"
"t7",0,"The opening finally came when Norman's left wings began retreating, but King Harold saw through the enemy's deception and issued an order to his commanders to stay on the defensive. But alas, the brave Saxons could not hear the order amidst the momentum and pursued the fleeing enemy.","14:00:00"
"t8",0,"William's hidden force began to flank the pursuing Saxon's force, and the fleeing infantries turned back to fight again. The Saxon fought valiantly but could not resist the attacks from both sides.","15:00:00"
"t9",0,"Out of only sheer luck, King Harold was shot by an arrow to the eye, and his two brothers fell in combat not long after. The fyrds began to rout immediately as the panic spread. The Huscarl chose to fulfil their oath of loyalty and avenge their true king. It is not an exaggeration to say that there are no better soldiers in the history of humanity than the Saxon Huscarls.",
"t10",0,"The battle raged on until night came, and the Huscarls still fought tirelessly. Unfortunately, the superior number force of William the Bastard finally managed to surround them as they had no hope to fight against the greatest on even term.","16:00:00"
"ld0","L2","Now that all of the pretenders to the throne of England are dead, King Harold can finally rule his kingdom in peace. The rumour about the ex-communication of King Harold faded away like a breeze in the night as Pope Alexander II sent a letter of congratulation for his decisive victory. Glory to the House of Godwinson, the chosen of God.",
"ld1","L26","The last Saxon king fell in the battle, but his men never surrender. William the Bastard now has to break through the final defence against tyranny.",
"wt1",0,"The true king of England fought well, and his legacy will never be forgotten. His people would resist the pretender William until the last and bring back the Saxon rule. History will remember the cruel slaughters and unforgivable crimes that William committed on the fair Saxon people.",
"wt2",0,"King Harold Godwinson’s foresight and military genius will remain in the pages of history as the greatest leader of all time. His righteous rule is unquestionable prevailed, and William the Bastard became no more than a small mention of history.",
