0,"Modern Historians","10,000 vs 7,000","Modern Historians, using estimation from the logistic probability and population of both England and Normandy at the time, came to the conclusion that both of the armies likely had between 7,000 to 14,000 troops each. With Harold’s army being the smaller one. The exact number is still inconclusive as each historian provides a varied number based on their reasoning.","(960,600,80);(570,600,80)","(550,200,120)"
1,"William of Poitiers*","60,000 vs 80,000","William of Poitiers was a French chronicler who wrote a record of the Invasion of England around a decade after. This record named ""Gesta Guillelmi"" provides detailed information of the event, albeit very likely in favour of the Norman. The record claims that Harold's army was actually the larger one of the two, although with no exact number provided. While William the conqueror's army had 50,000 in France and 60,000 troops before the battle.","(960,600,80);(570,600,80)","(550,200,120)"
2,"Carmen de Hastingae Proelio*","150,000 vs 1,200,000","Carmen de Hastingae Proelio or Carmen Widonis (Song of the Battle of Hastings) is one of the earliest records recounting the Battle of Hastings in the form of a poem. Possibly written only one year after the battle to celebrate the coronation of William the Conqueror. Similar to other Norman sources, Carmen also recounts the event in favour of the Norman force. As the poem was written, the Duke called upon 150,000 men to board the boat for invasion, and Harold sent a warning to William that he had 1,200,000 warriors who were thirsting for battle.","(960,600,80);(570,600,80)","(550,200,120)"
3,"Anglo-Saxon Chronicles*†","15,000 vs 10,000","Just like the Norman chronicles, Anglo-Saxons also wrote records of the battle in their own interpretation. There are various chronicles, whereas each provides a different story but all with favour for the Saxon side. The more famous ones can be found in Abingdon Abbey (usually referred to as the C version) and St Augustine Canterbury (the E Version). These Saxon chronicles generally state that Harold's army was smaller than that of William's. Possibly to minimise the significance of such defeat and lessen the accomplishment of the Norman. None of the versions usually provide an exact number for either side.","(960,600,80);(570,600,80)","(550,200,120)"
