"t0",0,"William of Poitiers wrote in Gesta Guillelmi that Harold Godwinson arrived at Senlac Ridge early at dawn with the intention to ambush Duke William's force at their camp. Fortunately, the Norman scouts detected the incoming Saxons and notified the Duke in time. The order was then timely given, and the men assembled in a quick fashion.",0,"08:00:00"
"t1",0,"William of Poitiers believed that the Norman force comprised of Breton’s cavalries on the left, the Frank on the right and Duke William and his Norman troop station at the centre. The front departments were filled with infantries and archers of similar direction as the cavalries.",0,"08:05:00"
"t2",0,"The battle started with Duke William ordering archers and crossbowmen to assault with rains of arrows. The event was followed by a series of change and melee combat between the infantries of the two forces throughout the day. ",0,"09:00:00"
"t3",0,"It is worth noting that William of Poitiers's story of the infantries' melee crash contradicts that of the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts mostly Norman horsemen fighting Saxon infantries. Additionally, he attributes the Saxons' early advantage to their superior number, high ground advantage, and the tight shield wall formation.",0,"10:00:00"
"t4",0,"Even William of Poitiers seems to accept that the English shield wall allowed them to withstand the charges. Although not as so impregnable that arrows and bolts could not deal death en masse.",0,"11:00:00"
"t5",0,"The battle raged on for the day. With swords and shields, axes and spears, bows and slings, only God can decide who is the righteous one to win and receive his glory.",0,"12:00:00"
"t6",0,"The Saxons and Normans could not turn the tide of battle to their sides. As the men of both forces were formidable in equal measure. This battle could only be decided by the ingenuity of their commanders.",0,"13:00:00"
"t7",0,"William of Poitiers wrote that William ordered the left flank to perform a feigned flight manoeuvre at around this time. The Saxon's right wing fell for this ingenious trap and ran down the hill to begin the pursuit. This blunder allowed William's cavalries and infantries to flank and envelop the pursuing Saxons.",0,"14:00:00"
"t8",0,"Interestingly, William of Poitiers did not detail the death of Harold in detail compared to other sources like the Carmen poem, which recites the event in all of its gory descriptions. The priest's chronicle only mentions that Harold and his two brothers were killed during the battle.",0,"15:00:00"
"t9",0,"Unlike the other sources, William of Poitiers attributes the Saxon loss to not only the death of their leader but also that their morale plummeted, for they knew they were no match against the Norman army. With complete exhaustion and no reinforcement on sight, the Saxon troops saw Duke William's determination only for absolute victory. Ergo they chose flight. The remaining Huscarls honoured their oath and fought till the last men.",0,"16:00:00"
"t10",0,"William of Poitiers describes the defeat of the Saxon army in great detail. He wrote that because their formations were packed very tight, most of the fleeing soldiers were unable to move, and the mass ended up crushing each other to death. A fitting end for the indiscipline force that boasts of their victories from only deception and number.",0,"17:00:00"
"ld0",2,"William of Poitiers also wrote that Duke William was believed to be dead during the battle from his horses and presumed dead by his troops. Upon hearing this report, the Duke removed his helmet and bravely rallied his men. Not once in any translation copy of Gesta Guillelmi mentions that Duke William fell in battle. Nevertheless, this is now the truth of history.",0,
"ld1",25,"With no more leader to command the army, the undisciplined fyrds began to waver in their spirit. The battlefield will soon be covered in the flowers of the English nobility and youth.",0,
"wt1",2,"This is the conquest that surpasses Caesar of Rome's accomplishment. King William the Conqueror prove his feat far beyond that of Hector and Achilles. The Battle of Hastings only served as the beginning of the true king, and his legacy will remain throughout history from the far west to the east end.",,
"wt2",25,"Gesta Guillelmi no longer is the tale of victory and compliments for the grossly exaggerated talent of the great Duke William. William of Poitiers instead lamented the treacherous tricks that Harold the pretender utilised to unchivalrously win the battle.",,
