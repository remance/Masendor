The battle that decided the fate of England, fought between the French Norman led by Duke William the Bastard, and English Saxon led by King Harold Godwinson.

Harold rushed his army all the way to the south of England in two weeks to intercept William's army near Hastings, losing many troops during the march.","On the night before the battle, both armies organised a ""ceremony"" to prepare for the battle to come. The Saxon army held a feast that lasts the whole night fill both food and alcohol, while the Norman army organised a Christian prayer for the troop by the clergymen and slept until the morning. The two armies march out early in the morning and start fighting at dawn around 9 AM until the beginning of dusk around 5 PM. No matter who wins this battle, England, led by the true king, would see major changes in every aspect. ",1,2,0,0
