"t0",0,"14th October 1066 AD, Duke William of Normandy and his force arrived at Telham Hill early in the morning, while Harold Godwinson’s force was already positioned at Senlac Ridge. It is believed that Harold intended to ambush the Normans at their camp and was surprised by William's early arrival at Telham Hill.",0,"08:00:00"
"t1",0,"Several history records suggest that William started descending from Telham Hill and positioned his army at the southern side of Senlac Ridge. With Breton’s troops on the left, Norman at the centre and Frankish at the right.",0,"08:05:00"

"t3",0,"As the range attacks proved to be ineffective against Saxon's shield wall, Duke William ordered the charge for all three main contingents around this time, while the remaining archers shot skyward at the troops behind the shield wall, thus also avoiding friendly fire.",0,"10:00:00"
"t4",0,"The shield wall was almost impregnable to both infantry and cavalry alike, as William's troops could not gain an advantage in this battle of attrition.",0,"11:00:00"
"t5",0,"Although many sources claimed that the battle was fought continuously for the whole day from morning till dawn. It is more likely that William ordered the main forces to temporarily retreated multiple times during the battle to recover from inevitable exhaustion, which in turn also allows Harold’s force to recuperate.

"t7",0,"At around this time, the Bretons on the left wing of William's force began to retreat.

Which allows William's reserved cavalries to flank and rally the fleeing infantries.",0,"14:00:00"
"t8",0,"With the loss of their right wing, the Saxon force lost all advantages they had in the battle.

The fleeing Saxon troops were pursued and killed all over the place, from the nearby forest to the countryside.",0,"17:00:00"
"ld0",2,"In the Battle of Hastings, many times Duke William was knocked down from his horses and presumed dead by his troops. And numerous times, he rallied back his men and assured them of his survival. This time, William's death becomes a reality in which the future of both England and the world is no longer perceivable.",0,
