1,"Unarmed",4,10,0,0,10,0,"To go into a battle unarmed is either bravely or lunacy.

Nevertheless unarmed class has sufficiently higher speed and melee attack than other melee class. Their attack also consume less stamina."
2,"Sword",10,15,10,0,0,0,"Sword is the most balanced weapon one can have. Simple to use but still difficult to master. It is also good for both offense and defense. The only weakness is that it has somewhat lower armour penetration capability than mace and hammer. It is worth mentioning that historically sword is somewhat expensive and rare weapon that mostly used by the rich or professional army. But it is still possible for lowly commoner to possess low quality or salvaged sword."

4,"Shortsword",8,10,5,0,0,0,

10,"Flail",7,50,15,0,4,0,"Flail is a mace with its head part attaching to chain. Although more difficult to use than mace, flail attack can be somewhat hard to predict and defend against. Its flexible swing means that the flail's head can land impact behind enemy's shield as well. "
11,"Hammer",6,65,18,0,5,0,"Hammer is a tool of blacksmith to shape up metal. Similar to mace, hammer is also good against armoured target where its impactful strikes can leave the unfortunate receiver with broken bones or concussion if aims for the head."

13,"Handaxe",11,30,15,0,2,0,"A tree cutting tool converted into weapon of war. Axe is simple enough to use effectively after some practices. The weight distribution design allow the momentum of axe swing to be powerful enough to break wooden shield or even metal one. "

16,"Pike",15,35,25,"22,23",7,0,"Pike is the most simple answer to the domination of cavalry. Why go attack them when you can let them come die at your weapon tip with their own speed.

27,"Light Crossbow",15,45,10,0,18,0,"The pinnacle of warfare. Easier to use than bow that any peasant can use after few days of training to kill a knight that train for their whole life.
