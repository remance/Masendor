19,"Units","The unit in this game can be in any larger number from Battalion to Division or even as low as Squadron. Because such standardisation of a military unit does not concretely exist in the Medieval period and the record of army organisation and deployment in the historical battles are often ambiguous, the unit deployment can only be accurate as the detail of the record and gameplay limitation.",,,"Unit is a group of sub-unit that can be directly controlled by the user. Each unit requires a minimum number of 10 sub-units at the start of the battle and can have up to 64 sub-unit maximum."

If the troop number reaches 0, the squad or battalion will be considered as destroyed."
23,"Stamina",,,,"Stamina represents the troops’ current capacity to perform physical activities. Each activity requires a specific amount of stamina to performed and drain stamina at different rate whether it be simply walking or using a special ability.

While the player cannot activate the units’ skill directly, it is possible to set a specific behaviour for each battalion between reserving the uses of skills or using them as often as possible. For example, one of the most common skill is “Charge” where a squad uses during running to attack its enemy. Charge skill allows the units to temporally boost their melee combat efficiency and also use special stat “charge power”, which increase the damage for a short duration. Charge skill cannot be activated if the units are already in melee combat."

Commander provides authority bonus to every battalion controlled by him and can issues special tactical command that affect command battalion in battlefield. There will be always one battalion directly controlled by the commander called command battalion and if that battalion is routed or destroyed, the whole army will suffer major morale penalty. In the command battalion, the commander will have one bodyguard squad that represent him in the battlefield. If that squad is destroyed, the commander will be considered as dead. The position of the bodyguard squad in the battalion also affect the authority as the leader who lead their troops at the front will assure confidence in his leadership, while leading from the back guarantee his safety but is often viewed as cowardice.

37,"Sub-General",,,,"Sub-general is the knight of an army. Sub-general is not required when creating battalion but they can bring many benefits to the battalion. Their main role is to support the general of battalion in his control and command and become his replacement if the general falls in battle. The replacement order is from left to right and there is no morale penalty for replacement until there is no general left leading the battalion. The authority bonus from sub-general is 50\% of the leader authority and command ability. Similar to the general, sub-generals also have their own bodyguard squads in the battalion. The position of the sub-general's squads do not affect the authority until they become general. Additionally, sub-generals can also use their unique abilities in the same way as general."
38,"Special",,,,"Special advisor is considered the bishop of an army. Although having the least important role in the battalion, special advisor can bring additional benefit to the battalion that may change the course of battle. The special advisor also has his own squad in the battalion but can provides only 25\% of the leader's authority and do not provide any benefit from the command ability at all. However, their special ability can still be used in the same way as general and sub-general, this make the role suitable for leaders that have good or unconventional ability but lousy command or authority. Nevertheless, special advisor will become general only if there are no general and sub-general left, so choose wisely who to be employed in special advisor role. "
