So does a person and his or her characteristics. But must so-called characteristic be constant? What would happen if a person can change his personality in the matter of friction of a second? Not simply faking it but completely alters it at the very core to become a completely new identity. Can such a thing even be called person anymore or it becomes something incomprehensible entirely? "
