# How to run/compile

If you want to download the release version to test the game, go
to [Release](https://github.com/remance/Masendor/releases) tags and [**
download**](https://github.com/remance/Masendor/releases/download/0.6.2.3/Dream.Decision.zip) the zip file. <br>

## Run

To start testing the game run `main.py` via Python interpreter for the source code or `main` file directly for the
release version. <br>

## System Requirements

### MINIMUM:

OS: Windows 7 (Haven't tested on Windows XP or Vista but may work), Ubuntu and macOS need further testing

Memory: 2GB RAM

Processor: Need more testing

Graphics: Need more testing

Storage: Currently 200 MB but likely around 500 MB available space in finished version.

### RECOMMEND:

OS: Windows 8, Ubuntu 22.04, macOS Monterey

Memory: 4GB RAM

Processor: Need more testing

Graphics: Need more testing

Storage: 1GB available space

## Compile

To compile the source code into an executable program, recommend using pyinstaller and `main.spec`. <br>

Check the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file for dependency requirements if running with the python source
code.<br>
Also, the game is now optimised based on the pygame 2.1.2 module and python 3.10. (may have to use cython later for a
huge size battle)

# Latest Update

![alt text](https://github.com/remance/preview/blob/main/preview.png?raw=true)

Refocus the game to arcade mode style for now to ensure that the game will ever be finished.

# Key features so far

## History is told by the victor, but sometimes the words of the loser do not fade away

> 14th October 1066 AD, Duke William of Normandy’s force arrived at Telham Hill early in the morning, while Harold
> Godwinson’s force was already positioned at Senlac Ridge. It is believed that Harold intent to ambush William's army at
> their camp and was surprised by William's arrival at Telham Hill.

> 14th October 1066 AD, King Harold Godwinson intercepted William the Bastard’s force at Senlac Ridge, Hastings. The
> rightful king of England refused to cover in a castle before the pretender and bravely marched his army to crush the
> enemy head-on.

Have you ever find it weird that most historical games follow only a specific version of the story? Even a single battle
may have more than one side of the story.<br>
For example, the Normans say they are the underdog in the Battle of Hastings, while the Saxons also say they are the
underdog.<br>
Well in this game, all versions of the story are accepted and represented. Every preset historical map will have more
than 1 source of information that dictates the story tone, army composition, size, even formation and possibly more.

## Army is led by more than just a king
 
Troops in each army can be led by multiple leaders with chain of command and every
historical battle will have all the named people that participated in the battle.

## Extremely easy map creation

Most of the battle map creator requires a degree of learning to use effectively. Well in this game you just need to
use MS Paint or any drawing software ([GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
, [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), etc.) to create a map.<br>
Draw the image with the right colour set and the game will convert them into a playable map. Most other map functions
are also very easy to create and modify.

## Encyclopedia and stuff

This game's encyclopedia will have more information than just from the Wikipedia website as long as they can be found
that is.

![alt text](https://github.com/remance/preview/blob/main/lore.gif?raw=true)

This function is going to be a headache to write and research. But hopefully, it will provide useful and interesting
historical information to players.

---------------

For those who have read this far, thank you for your interest in the game. To be honest, every single update begins with
how do I even start with this.

I start developing this game with zero knowledge in video game development let alone how to use pygame. I start learning
how to use pygame by tinkering with `alien.py` in the pygame `examples` folder and keep testing/changing it until it became
what you can see right now (I keep most video updates on YouTube which show the progress of improvement almost from the
start). All of the plans I list for the future are the same. I have no idea how to do it, the only thing I have is the
picture of what I want to make it look like. Nevertheless, it is fun figuring stuff out and don't let the lack of
knowledge stop you from making your own game :P.
