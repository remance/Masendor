# Web Wiki

The purpose of the Web Wiki is to create a web based Encyclopedia of the game. There is already a Encyclopedia in the game but having it in web would make it more easy to access. We could host this wiki on the internet which wouldn't require a reader to download and running the full game to read the Encyclopedia. Also making a Encyclopedia can be a lot easier and some people enjoy using web more.

## Only read-only

As of writting this this wiki is read only but we could of course add write functionality like renaming leaders and adding more history.
